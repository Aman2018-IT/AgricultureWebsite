          <h1 style=" font-size: 60px; text-align: center; color: white;"><i>PINEAPPLE</i></h1>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit and the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae. The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries.</i>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Pineapple is tropical fruit. It requires moderate temperature and high humidity. The optimum temperate range is 210C to 230C. At low temperature, no fruit bud differentiation takes place.</p>      
    </div>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Pineapple grows in almost any type of soil, provided it is free-draining. Slightly acidic soil with pH range of 5.5 to 6.0 is considered optimum for pineapple cultivation. The soil should be well drained and light in texture. Heavy clay soil is not suitable. It can grow in sandy, alluvial or laterite soil.
            </p>
    </div>        

    <div class="Place">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Place of cultivation:</i></strong></h3>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The major pineapple producing states in India are Assam, West Bengal, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala and Bihar. Currently, India produces 1.53 million tonnes of pineapple with productivity of 15.3 t/ha.</p>

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Pesticides requirement:</i></strong></h3>
            
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Manures, Fertilizer and Nutrient Management in Pineapple Crop: Pineapple is a shallow feeder with high nitrogen and potassium requirement. Experts based on research trials conducted at a number of locations advise giving N and K2O at 12 g each per plant. There is no need for P application.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Water">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">During summer months, pineapple should be irrigated wherever possible at 0.6 IW/ CPE ratio (50 mm depth of water). It requires five or six irrigations during dry months at an interval of 22 days. Mulching the crop with dry leaves at 6 t per ha will help to conserve moisture.

        <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">There are different varieties of pineapple which are commonly grown all
            over the world. Most common variety grown under in India are - Kew, Giant Kew, Queen,
            Mauritius, jaldhup, lakhat etc. Among these variety Kew/ Gient Kew and Queen are commonly
            grown in the north eastern part of India and is believed to be best suited for these part of the
            country.

                            <strong><u>Land Preparation</u>:</strong><br>
                            The land is prepared for planting by ploughing or digging followed by leveling. Depending on the nature of land, trenches of convenient length, about 90 cm. width and 15-30 cm. depth are prepared.<br><br>
                            
                            <strong><u>Planting</u>:</strong><br><br>

                            --><i><u>Planting Material</u></i>:<br>
                            Pineapple is usually propagated by sucker, slip and crown. These planting materials of 5-6 months age bear flowers after 12 months of planting except crowns which bear flowers after 19-20 months. Pineapple plants produced through tissue culture are also available for cultivation. <br><br>
                           
                           --><i><u>Treatment of Planting material</u></i>:<br>
                            Planting material is dipped in ceresan solution (4 g. in 1 l. of water) or 0.2 % Dithane M-45 before planting to protect the plants against bud rot.<br><br>
                            
                           --><i><u>Planting season</u></i>:<br>
                            The ideal time of planting is 12-15 months before the peak flowering season under natural conditions, which varies from December to March in different regions. Time of planting also varies from place to place depending upon the time of onset of the monsoon and the intensity of its precipitation. In Assam, planting should be done during August-October, while in Kerala and Karnataka; the best time of planting is April-June. Planting is usually avoided during the period of heavy rains. The ideal time for planting in northern part of West Bengal is October-November and June-July for other parts. Delaying in planting as late as September, delays crop at least by 7-9 months. The peak flowering period is from January to March.<br><br>
                             
                           --><i><u>Spacing</u></i>:<br>
                            For commercial viability high density cultivation is recommended.  Planting density of 63,400 plants/ha. (22.5 x 60 x 75 cm.) is ideal for sub-tropical and mild humid conditions, whereas for hot and humid conditions a plant density of 53,300 plants/ha. spaced at 25 cm. from plant to plant within a row, 60 cm. from row to row and 90 cm. from trench to trench (25 x 60 x 90 cm.) provides high yield. In rainfed, high fertile and hilly areas in north eastern states, a somewhat lower density of 31,000 plants/ha. is recommended.<br><br>
                            
                           --><i><u>High Density Planting</u></i>:<br>
                             The yield of 70-105 tonnes/ha. may be obtained under high density planting , the increase in yield/unit area being 45-85 tonnes/ha. Less weed infestation , protection of fruits from sun burn, increased production of propagules (suckers and slips)/unit area and non-lodging of plants are added advantages of high density planting.
                             <br><br>

                           --><i><u>Planting Method</u></i>:<br>
                            Four different planting systems viz. flat-bed, furrow, contour and trench are followed. System of planting varies according to land and rainfall. In the slopes, terracing or contour planting is adopted which helps to check soil erosion. Trench planting is usually followed in Kerala.<br><br>
                            
                           <strong><u>Nutrition</u>:</strong><br>
                           A dose of N, P2O5 and K2O at 12,4 and 12 g./plant/year respectively is optimum under Jorhat conditions. No response to P application has been observed. However, in the ratoon crop 4 g. P2O5/plant increases fruit weight and yield. Plants receiving 12 g.  K2O/plant/crop give higher yield without any adverse effect on fruit quality both under irrigated and rainfed conditions. For medium fertile soils in West Bengal, N (12-16g.), P2O5 (2-4g.) and K2O (10-12 g.)/plant are optimum. It is recommended to apply N and K2O each @ 12g./plant. There is no need for P application. However, if the soils are poor in P, 4g.  P2O5/plant can be applied. N should be applied in 6 split doses. The first dose of N can be given two months after planting and the last one 12 months after planting. The K should be applied in two split doses. Entire P and half of K can be given at the time of planting and the remaining K, 6 months after planting. Application of fertilizers under rainfed conditions should be done when moisture is available.<br><br>
                          
                           <strong><u>Irrigation</u>:</strong><br>
                           Pineapple is mostly cultivated under rainfed conditions. Supplementary irrigation helps to produce good sized fruits in areas having optimum rainfall. Irrigation also helps to establish an off-season planting to maintain its year round production. In case of scanty rainfall and hot weather, irrigation may be provided once in 20-25 days. <br><br>
                           
                            <strong><u>Intercultural Operations</u>:</strong><br>
                             Weeding is done at least three to four times in a year. Hand weeding can be partially eliminated by application of weedicides. Earthing up is an essential operation in pineapple cultivation aimed at good anchorage to the plants. Soon after harvest, earthing up is done leaving one to two suckers only.  Weeds are effectively controlled by application of diuron (@ 2 kg./ha.) or a combination of Bromacil and diuron @ 2 kg./ha. each as pre-emergent spray and repeated with half of the dose , 5 months after first application.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Mulching</u>:</strong><br>
                            Dry leaves or straw is used as a mulching material. Mulching with black polythene and saw dust has been found to be effective. The maturing fruits may be covered with rice straw or pineapple leaves in order to reduce both sun burn and damage caused by the birds.<br><br>
                            
                          <strong><u>Growth regulators</u>:</strong><br>
                            Application of NAA and related compounds viz. Planofix and Celemone @ 10-20 ppm. induces flowering in pineapple. Application of NAA (200-300 ppm.), two to three months after fruit set increases 15-20% fruit size. To get year round availability of pineapple it should be planned at regular intervals round the year. The application of 50 ml. solution/plant containing calcium carbide (20g./litre) or Ethrel (0.25 ml./l.) causes flower induction.<br><br> 
                             
                          <strong><u>Removal of suckers, slips and crowns</u>:</strong><br>
                             
                            Suckers start growing with the emergence of inflorescence, whereas slips grow with the developing fruits. The fruit weight increases with increasing number of suckers/plant, while the increased number of slips delays fruit maturity. Crown size has no bearing on the fruit weight or quality. Hence desuckering can be delayed as much as possible, while the slips are recommended to be removed as soon as they attain the size required for planting. Removal of crown is not required as it mars the appeal of the fruit and also makes handling difficult. Partial pinching of crown consisting of the removal of the innermost whorl of leaflets along with growing tips 45 days after fruit set is ideal to get fruits of better size and shape. <br><br>
                            
                          <strong><u>Plant Protection Measures</u>:</strong><br><br>
                             
                             --><u>Insect Pests</u>:Pineapple is usually free from pests except infestation of mealy bugs and scale insects in sporadic cases.<br>
                             
                             --><u>Diseases</u>: Diseases are not common except stem rot in case of pineapple. Control measures include good drainage and dipping the suckers in Boradeaux mixture before planting.<br><br>
                            
                           <strong><u>Harvesting  and Yield</u>:</strong><br>
                            Pineapple plants flower 12-15 months after planting and the fruits become ready 15-18 months after planting depending upon the variety, time of planting, type and size of plant material used and prevailing temperature during the fruit development. Under natural conditions, pineapple comes to harvest during May-August. The fruit usually ripens about 5 months after flowering. Irregular flowering results in the harvesting spread over a long period. In order to get uniform flowering (over 80%) in the main season, Ethrel (@ 100 ppm.) solution is applied to plants one month before flowering.
                            The fruits are harvested for canning purpose when there is a slight change at the base of developing fruits. The fruits used for table purpose are retained till they develop golden yellow colour.
                            The plant crop after harvest can be retained as ratoon crop for three to four years depending upon the soil condition. Ratooning in high density planting reveals that the average fruit weight in the first and second ratoon is 88% and 79% respectively of the plant crop. The plant stand is also reduced gradually resulting in the reduction of fruit yield by 49 and 46% (approx.) in first and second ratoon crops respectively.
                            The average yield is 50-80 tonnes/ha. depending upon spacing and cultural practices.<br><br>
                            
                            <strong><u>POST HARVEST MANAGEMENT</u>:</strong><br><br>
                             --><u>Grading</u>:
                             Fruits are graded on the basis of their weight, size and colour.<br><br>
                            
                            --><u>Storage</u>:
                             Fruits with crown can be kept without damage for 10-15 days after harvesting. When fruits are transported to long distances or for a period of several days, refrigerated transport is required to slow down ripening process. Pineapples can be stored well for a period of 20 days when refrigerated at 10-130 C. The best storage is at 7.20 C and 80 or 90% relative humidity.<br><br>
                            
                             --><u>Packing</u>:
                             Fruits are packed in baskets woven with bamboo strips. For local markets, the fruits are arranged in baskets (each weighing 20-25 kg.) lined with paddy straw to stand on their stumps. The second layer of fruits is arranged on the crowns of the first layer of fruits. For distant markets, fruits are wrapped individually with paddy straw and then packed.<br><br>
                            
                             --><u>Transportation</u>:                            
                            Road transport by trucks/lorries is the most popular mode of transport due to easy approach from orchards to the market. <br><br> 
                              
                            --><u>Marketing</u>:
                            The growers usually dispose off their produce at the farm gate to the middlemen. Majority of the cultivators sell their crop either through trade agents at village level or commission agents at the market.
