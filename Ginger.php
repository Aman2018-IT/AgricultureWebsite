          <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"> Ginger (अदरक) an indigenous plant, is an important spice crop of the world. It is valued in medicine as a carminative and stimulant of the gastro-intestinal tract.</i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Ginger grows best in warm and humid climate. It is mainly cultivated in the tropics from sea level to an altitude of 1500m, both under rainfed and irrigated conditions.</p>

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">For successful cultivation of the crop, a moderate rainfall at the sowing time till the rhizomes sprout, fairly heavy and well-distributed showers during the growing period, and dry weather with a temperature of 280 to 350C for about a month before harvesting are necessary. Prevalence of high humidity throughout the crop period is desirable. Ginger thrives best in well-drained soils like sandy or clay loam, red loam or lateritic loam. A friable loam, rich in humus are ideal. However, being an exhaustive crop, soil should be rich in fertility.</p>

                        Ginger requires 1300-1500 mm of water during its crop cycle. The critical stages for irrigation are during germination, rhizome initiation (90 DAP) and rhizome development stages (135 DAP).

            Several cultivars of ginger are grown in the different ginger growing areas in India. They are generally named after the localities or places where they are grown. Some of the more prominent indigenous types are Maran (Assam), Kuruppampadi, Ernad and Wynad local (all from Kerala). A high yielding introduction Rio-de-Janeiro has become very popular among the growers. Its yield potential is 25 to 35 tonnes per ha. The fiber content is 5.19 % and dry ginger recovery is 16-18 %. Recently, High Altitude Research Station, Pottangi (Orissa) has released three improved varieties.

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>1.<u>Land preparation and sowing</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            Preparation of land starts with the receipt of early summer showers. The land is to be ploughed 4 to 5 times or dug thoroughly to bring the soil to fine tilth. Weeds, stubbles, roots etc. are removed. Beds of about one metre width, 15-cm height and of any convenient length are prepared at an interspace of 40-50 cm in between beds. In the case of irrigated crops, ridges are formed 40 cm apart.
                          
                                 <br><br>
                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>2.<u>Planting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            Ginger is always propagated by portions of the rhizomes, known as seed rhizomes. Carefully preserved seed rhizomes are cut into small pieces of 2.5 – 5.0 cm length weighing 20-25 g, each having one or two good buds. The seed rate varies from 1500 to 1800 kg per ha from region to region. The seed rhizomes are treated with 0.3 % Dithane M 45 for 30 min, drained and planted at a spacing of 20-25 cm along the rows and 20-25 cm between the rows.  
                                 <br><br>
                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;">
                            <strong><i>3.<u> Manures and fertilizers</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            At the time of planting, well decomposed cattle manure or compost at the rate of 25-30 tonnes per ha along with 2 tonnes of neem cake is to be applied along with 50 kg P2O5 and 25 kg K2O. They may be applied either by broadcast over the beds prior to planting or applied in pits at the time of planting. Besides, 75kg of Nitrogen /ha is recommended which is to be applied in two equal split doses at 40 and 90 days after planting. The plants are to be earthed up, after each top dressing with the fertilizers and beds rectified. <br><br>

                                <strong><i>4.<u>Harvesting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                                Harvesting is done from 6th month onwards for marketing the produce as green ginger. The rhizomes are thoroughly washed in water two or three times to remove the soil and dirt and sun dried for a day. For preparing the dry ginger, the crop is harvested between 245 to 260 days. When the leaves turn yellow and start gradually drying up, the clumps are lifted carefully with a spade or digging fork and the adhering soil removed. The average yield per ha varies from 15 to 25 tonnes.

                                For preparing dry ginger, the produce is kept soaked in water overnight. The rhizomes are then rubbed well to clean them. After cleaning, the rhizomes are removed from the water and the outer skin is removed with bamboo splinters having pointed ends. The peeled rhizomes are washed and dried in sun uniformly for one week. The dry rhizomes are rubbed together in order to get rid of the last bit of the skin or dirt. These are called unbleached ginger. To get good appearance, peeled rhizomes are soaked in 2% limewater for 6 hours and then dried and this is known as bleached ginger. The yield of dry ginger is 16-25 % of the fresh ginger depending on the variety, location etc.

                                <strong><i>5.<u>Pest and Diseases</u>:</i></strong><br>
                                Nematodes, Slugs, and Snails, Leafminers and Mites are the major insects that harm ginger. Needless to say that if Grow ginger for more than one year you will face this dangerous species. 
                                              <br><br>
                                Nematodes: on-segmented roundworms attack the bulb tubers, producing lesions that cause them susceptive to fungal or bacterial attack resulting in the lower increase of plants. Cleanliness helps to destroy the hiding areas of pests. 
                                <br>
                                 Slugs and snails: They eat fresh leaves plus the tips of adult leaves. To protect facing slugs and snails.the farming fields by keen sand or bark mulch. <br>
                                 Mites: infestation generally happens in early stages. Insecticidal soap shower can fairly useful against Mites.
