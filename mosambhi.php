            <p style="color: black;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Mosambi is small to medium in size, averaging seven centimeters in diameter, and is round to oval in shape with a slightly lumpy exterior. The medium-thick, leathery rind has many small, prominent oil glands and transforms from green to a blend of yellow, orange, and green hues when mature.</i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">For commercial Mosambi cultivation, a dry climatic condition with about 60 to 75 cm of rainfall from June to September is required. It also needs well-defined summer and winter seasons.</p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Soil Requirement for Mosambi Cultivation. Mosambi plants thrive well in well-drained red soils or loamy soils. The soil pH should be between 6.5 to 7.5 for optimal growth and higher yields.</p>

                            <strong><u>Propagation</u>:</strong><br>
                            Mosambi propagates during their budding stage. The root-stock raised in nurseries is later transplanted to the main field.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Land preparation, Planting, and Spacing</u>:</strong><br>
                            The field should be prepared well by ploughing. Land should be properly levelled and brought to a fine tilth stage. Previous weeds and rock particles should be removed as a part of land preparation. Suitable pits should be prepared with a dimension of 3 ft(W) x 3 ft(L) x 3 ft(Depth). The pit-to-pit or plant-to-plant distance should be about 20 to 22 feet. A row-to-row distance of 20 to 22 feet should be maintained. It is recommended to expose the tree saplings to the sun for a couple of weeks before starting the plantation. It is better to plant mosambi at good distances as these trees go very big and occupy a large space.<br>
                            
                            We should purchase a high quality, disease-free mosambi plant from certified nurseries to transplant in our field. These seedling/saplings should be at least 2 years old. Place the saplings at the centre of the pit and cover them with topsoil. Donâ€™t forget to irrigate them immediately.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Irrigation</u>:</strong><br>
                            Watering should be done immediately after planting the saplings, which helps in proper root establishments. The frequency of irrigation depends on climatic conditions, the variety of the plant, and the soil type. We should ensure good soil moisture at the plant base.<br>
                            
                            In winter, irrigation should be carried out for every 3 to 4 days and in summer, every alternate day. Try to avoid excess irrigation as these plants cannot tolerate water-logging. Drip irrigation system is recommended for best yields and plant growth. A subsidy would be available for drip irrigation system from the local horticulture department.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Pruning Operations</u>:</strong><br>
                            Pruning is the process of removing unwanted leaves/branches/stems. Pruning is done for straight growth and to form a strong framework of the plant. For proper growth of the trunk, remove the shoots in 50 cm to 60 cm near ground level. Centre of the mosambi plant should remain open. Make sure to remove water suckers at early stages of plant growth. <br><br>
                           
                            <strong><u>Manures and Fertilizers to be Used</u>:</strong><br>
                            FYM, phosphorus, and potash should be applied in the month of October. Nitrogen is applied in 2 doses during March and October.
                            
                            Manures should be applied in the basin 75 cm away from the trunk and incorporated in the soil. Solution containing Sulphate of Zinc (0.5%), Iron (0.25%), Magnesium (0.5%), Manganese (0.05%), Boron (0.1%) and Molybdenum (0.003%) should be sprayed once in 90 days at the time of new flush production. In addition to these, apply 50 gram in each of Sulphate of Zinc, Manganese and Iron/tree/year.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Intercultural Operations</u>:</strong><br>
                            --><u>Weed Control</u>:<br> Manual weeding at plant base and shallow cultivation between rows for every 4 months should be carried out with care. There are many herbicides available to effectively control the weeds in Mosambi cultivation. We could make use of glyphosate at the rate of 1.6 litre/150 litres of water. Take care to use glyphosate only on weeds, not on Mosambi plants.<br>
                            
                            --><u>Mulching</u>: We can mulch the plants for controlling soil temperatures which save the water from evaporation. We can use plastic mulch materials available in the market.<br>
                            
                            --><u>Intercrops</u>: Inter-spaces are made in a mosambi orchard for growing nitrogen-fixing crops until the plants start flowering during initial 3 years of plantation. Green gram, black gram or any other legume crops, groundnut, vegetables like beans etc are cultivated to be used as nitrogen fixation crop.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Pests and Diseases</u>:</strong><br>
                            -->Pests: Leaf miner, citrus Psylla, scale insects and aphids, and mealybugs are common pests found in mosambi cultivation.<br>
                            
                            -->Diseases: Citrus / mosambi canker, gummosis, powdery mildew, black spot, zinc deficiency, and iron deficiency are common diseases found in mosambi cultivation.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Harvesting</u>:</strong><br>
                            Mosambi plant starts flowering after 3 years of plantation. These flowerings should be removed for better and string fruiting for next year. We could expect yield from the 4th year of plantation. Manual harvesting of these fruits can be facilitated using a sharp sickle. Two harvest seasons are available in a year, April to May and August to September. Usually, mosambi fruit turns green to light yellowish colour on attaining maturity. Pluck the fruits before they are fully ripe.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Yield</u>:</strong><br>
                            Yield depends on soil type, variety, irrigation, plant age, season and other crop management practices. Commercial yield is expected only after the 4th year of plantation. Initially, we can get 60 kg/plant or 5 tonnes/acre. After the 5th year, yield increases to 100 kg/plant or 9 tonnes /acre. The yield reaches its peak after 10 years. The economical lifespan of mosambi is about 20 years. The yield decreases gradually when the plant reaches its last few years of lifespan.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Post Harvesting</u>:</strong><br>
                            Harvested Mosambi fruits should be cleaned, graded (on size and colour), packed and transported to the local fruit markets. These fruits can be sold in both wholesale and retail markets. They are also sold to different fruit selling agents.
