            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>The onion (प्याज) also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium  .</i></p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong> <i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Onion is a temperate crop but can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions such as temperate, tropical and subtropical climate. The best performance can be obtained in a mild weather without the extremes of cold and heat and excessive rainfall. However, onion plant is hardy and in the young stage can withstand freezing temperature also. In India, short-day onion is grown in the plains and requires 10-12 hours day length. The long-day onion is grown in hills requiring 13-14 hours day length. For vegetative growth, lower temperature combined with short photoperiod is required whereas relatively higher temperature along with longer photoperiod is required for bulb development and maturity. The optimum temperature for vegetative phase and bulb development is 13-24˚C and 16-25˚C, respectively. It requires about 70% relative humidity for good growth. It can grow well in places where the average annual rainfall is 650-750 mm with good distribution during the monsoon period. Areas with low (< 650 mm) or heavy rainfall (>750 mm) are not particularly suitable for rain-fed crop

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Onion can be grown in all types of soils such as sandy loam, clay loam, silt loam and heavy soils. However, the best soil for successful onion cultivation is deep, friable loam and alluvial soils with good drainage, moisture holding capacity and sufficient organic matter. In heavy soils, the bulbs produced may be deformed. Onion crop can be grown successfully on heavy soil with application of organic manure prior to planting and preparation of the field for onion cultivation should be very good. The optimum pH range, regardless of soil type, is 6.0 - 7.5, but onion can also be grown in mild alkaline soils. Onion crop is more sensitive to highly acidic, alkali and saline soils and water logging condition. Onions do not thrive in soils having pH below 6.0 because of trace element deficiencies, or occasionally, Al or Mn toxicity. The threshold electrical conductivity of a saturation extract (ECe) for onion crop is 4.0 dS/m. When the ECe level exceeds this, crop yield starts declining.

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
                There are three sowing seasons for the onion crop in India – Kharif (planted between July-August and harvested in October-December); late Kharif (planted between October-November and harvested in January-March); and Rabi (planted between December-January and harvested in March-May). </p>

                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
                        The onion crop requires 350 to 550 mm of water throughout the growth cycle. It is recommended to give frequent, light irrigations which are timed when about 25 percent of available water in the top 30 cm of soil is depleted. Irrigation intervals of 2-4 days are a common practice.

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>1.<u>Land preparation </u>:</i></strong><br>
                          
                            Prior to transplanting, field should be ploughed and disked properly to eliminate debris and soil clods. Organic manures equivalent to 75 kg N/ha (approximately FYM 15 t/ha or poultry manure 7.5 t/ha or vermicompost 7.5 t/ha) should be incorporated at the time of last ploughing and beds with appropriate size should be prepared after leveling. Mostly, flat beds of the size 1.5-2.0 m width and 4-6 m length is formed. However, flat bed should be avoided to prevent water logging during Kharif or rainy season. Water logging favours Anthracnose disease which is most devastating during Kharif season. Broad bed furrows (BBF) of 15 cm height and 120 cm top width with 45 cm furrow are formed to achieve proper spacing and population density. It is suitable for drip and sprinkler irrigation as well. BBF is the best method for Kharif onion production because the excess water can be drained out through the furrow. This improves the aeration and helps in reducing the incidence of Anthracnose disease.

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>2.<u>Transplanting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                          
                            Proper care should be taken while selecting seedlings for transplanting. Over and under aged seedlings should be avoided for better establishment. At the time of transplanting, one third of the seedling top should be cut to get good establishment. The onion seedling should be transplanted after dipping roots in carbendazim solution (0.1%) for two hours to reduce the incidence of fungal diseases during the establishment. The optimum spacing is 15 cm between the rows and 10 cm between plants.

                                 <br><br>
                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>3.<u>Irrigation</u>:</i></strong><br>
                          
                            Irrigation requirement of onion depends upon the season, soil type, method of irrigation and age of the crop. In general, onion needs irrigation at the time of transplanting, three days after transplanting and subsequently at   7-10 days interval depending upon the soil moisture. In general, Kharif crop needs 5-8 irrigations, the late Kharif crop requires 10-12 and Rabi crop needs 12-15 irrigations. Onion being a shallow rooted crop, needs frequent light irrigation to maintain optimum soil moisture for proper growth and bulb development. Irrigation needs to be stopped when the crop attains maturity (10-15 days before harvest) and the top starts falling which helps in reducing the rotting during storage. Excess irrigation is always harmful and dry spell followed by irrigation will result in the splitting of the outer scales and also formation of bolters. Water loss with flood irrigation is too high due to conveyance, seepage and percolation losses. <br> <br>

                            Modern irrigation techniques such as drip and micro sprinkler irrigation help in saving irrigation water and improve the marketable bulb yield significantly. In case of drip irrigation, seedlings need to be planted at a spacing of 10 x 15 cm in a broad bed furrow (BBF) of 15 cm height and 120 cm top width with 45 cm furrow. Each BBF should have two drip laterals at (16 mm size) 60 cm distance with inbuilt emitters. The distance between two inbuilt emitters should be around 30-50 cm and the discharge flow rate is 4 l/hr. In case of micro sprinkler, the distance between two laterals (20 mm) of micro sprinkler should be 6m with a discharge rate of 135 l/hr. The research outcome indicated that the drip irrigation at 100 % Pan Evaporation (PE) significantly improved the marketable bulb yield (15-25%) with higher per cent A grade bulbs, water saving of about 35-40% and labour saving of 25-30% as compared to flood irrigation.

                            <strong><i>4.<u> Manures and fertilizers</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            In general,soil for onion growing should be liberally manured and fertilized. About 20-25 tonnes of farmyard/ha adequate. The requirement of nutrients depends on soil type, region of growing, varieties and removal of major nutrients. Onion crop yielding 300 q/ha removes 73 kg nitrogen, 36 kg phosphorus and 68 kg potassium. As it depends on the variety, season etc. soil analysis for application of fertilizers is preferred. <br> <br>

                            Farmyard manure should be applied one month before transplanting / planting or sowing and mixed well in the soil. Whole quantity of phosphorus, potassium and half of nitrogen should be mixed in the soil before transplanting. Remaining half of nitrogen should be given as topdressing in single dose in bulblet method of planting in big onions and bulblet method of planting in multiplier onion 20-25 days after planting. In transplanting method, topdressing is taken up in 2 split doses and first dose should be applied at 30 days after transplanting whereas second dose 45 days after transplanting. The topdressing must be completed before initiation of bulbing. Delayed application results in thick neck or doubles. <br><br>
                        
                            In addition to fertilizer, application of micronutrients is beneficial in improving the quality of bulbs. Application of zinc copper and boron increases the yield and enhances quality of bulbs by increasing TSS, sugar and ascorbic acid.

                                <strong><i>5.<u>Harvesting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            
                                Onion is harvested depending upon the purpose for which the crop is planted. 0nion crop is ready for harvesting in five months for dry onion. However, for marketing as green onion, the crop becomes ready in three months after transplanting. <br><br>

                                When the bulbs developing from the leaf bases of onions are fully formed, the leafy green tops begin to yellow and eventually collapse at a point a little above the top of the bulb, leaving an upright short neck. When the tops "go down" in this way, the bulbs are ready for harvesting. Because all the onions in a crop do not mature at the same time, large-scale commercial growers harvest them when about half the tops have gone down. <br><br>
                                
                                In kharif season, since tops do not fall, bulbs are harvested soon after the colour of leaves changes to slightly yellow and red pigmentation on bulbs develop. Best time to harvest rabi onion is one week after 50% tops have fallen over. Onions for sale as dried bulbs or for storage should be harvested progressively after tops have started falling over. <br><br>
                                
                                Since onion bulbs are normally formed at the soil surface, it is sometimes possible in sandy soils to pull the mature bulbs by hand. Where conditions make hand pulling impossible, crop is harvested by loosening the bulbs with a fork or hoe before lifting them. The harvested crop is left in windrows in the field for a few days until the tops are dry. The windrows should be made so that the green tops cover the bulbs to protect them from sunburn. The leaves are cut leaving about 2-2.5 cm tops above the bulb after complete drying. This practice helps to increase the dry matter content. If tops are cut too close, the neck does not close well and provides entry for decay organisms. <br><br>
                                
                                Early harvest results in sprouting of the bulbs and late harvest results in formation of secondary roots during storage. In kharif season, late harvesting results in doubles and bolting.
