            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Kiwifruit (commonly shortened to kiwi in North America) or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa 'Hayward') is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg: 5–8 centimetres (2–3 inches) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1+3⁄4–2+1⁄4 in) in diameter. It has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart but edible light brown skin and light green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour. In 2018, China produced half of the world total of kiwifruit.</i></p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Kiwi can be grown in areas experiencing 700-800 chilling hours (no. of hours during which temperature remains at or below 70 C during the winter season). The plant can be grown at 800-1500 m. above m.s.l. A rainfall of about 150 cm. /year is sufficient.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Deep, rich, well-drained sandy loam soils are ideal for cultivation of kiwi. A soil pH slightly less than 6.9 results in maximum yield but higher pH upto 7.3 adversely affects the yield due to Mn deficiency.</p>

    <div class="Place">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Place of cultivation:</i></strong></h3>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Kiwi is mostly grown in the mid hills of Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, J & K, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Kerala. Having been very newly introduced in the country estimates of area and production have not yet become available. </p>

    <div class="Pesticides">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Pesticides requirement:</i></strong></h3>
            
                    <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">  Kiwifruit plants are relatively free from pest problems, possibly due to their lack of heavy planting in localized
                        areas.</strong><br><br> 
                      
                        • Scale (greedy, latania, oleander) insects can be a problem if populations build up too extensively; if
                        present in the soil, nematodes will reduce plant vigor.
                        <br><br>
                        • Of the four leaf-rolling caterpillars that attack kiwifruit (omnivorous, fruit-tree, oblique-banded, and
                        orange tortrix), omnivorous leaf roller is the most common and the most damaging.
                        <br><br>
                        • Phytophthora crown and root rot is one of the more serious diseases of kiwi grown in California.
                        <br><br>
                        • Botrytis, or gray mold, is the most important post-harvest disease of kiwifruit in California; since the
                        pathogen requires free-moisture for spore germination and infection, disease is more severe when
                        rainy weather occurs during bloom.
                        <br><br>
                        • Kiwifruit plants can be severely damaged by root knot nematodes.
                        <br><br>
                        • Two-spot spider mites can build up on plants during hot, dry weather, particularly on plants grown in
                        greenhouses and occasionally on plants grown outside.
                        <br><br>
                        • Perennial grasses (Bermuda grass, Johnsongrass, and dallisgrass) are persistent weeds in kiwifruit
                        vineyards.
                        <br><br>
                        • Major vertebrate pests of kiwifruit include gophers, squirrels, rats, and rabbits. Deer can cause
                        problems by feeding on the leaves; voles can be pests in kiwifruit vineyards where weed growth is
                        not controlled.

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The plant can be grown at 800-1500 m. above m.s.l. A rainfall of about 150 cm. /year is sufficient. The rainfall should be well distributed during the growing period. The plant does not withstand strong winds and frost during the growing period because of its vigorous vegetative growth, large leaves and viny habit.

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
                            <strong><i>1.<u>Land Preparation </u>:</i></strong><br>           

                            For the plantation of kiwi, steep land can be contoured into terraces. Plant should get maximum sunlight, so rows can be oriented to north-south direction. Best month for plantation of kiwi is January, so pitting and manuring should be done by December month.<br><br>

                            <strong><i>2.<u>   Plantation  </u>:</i></strong><br>
                         
                            Kiwi plants can be propagated by seed/seedling/grafting. And plantation is usually done in the month of January. For the plantation, arbor or pergola system framework is used with 6m distance in rows. And for the pollination in plants, male to female plants ratio is maintained as 1:5.<br><br>

                            <strong><i>3.<u>  Cold Protection  </u>:</i></strong><br> 
                            
                            During Spring and Autumn, protection from cold is necessary, otherwise it will damage kiwi vines. Wind machines and water sprinklers can be used to protect kiwi vines.  <br><br>
                            
                            <strong><i>4.<u>  Fertilizer Requirements  </u>:</i></strong><br>                           
                            
                            For the healthy growth of kiwi, required fertilizer amount is, 20kg farmyard manure, 0.5 kg NPK mixture containing 15% Nitrogen application every year. After 5 years, same dose of farmyard manure and NPK dose as explained, Nitrogen 850-900 g, Phosphorus 500-600 g and Potassium 800-900 g every year. <br><br>
                           
                            <strong><i>5.<u> Kiwi Pruning and Training</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            
                            And kiwi vines grow so much and become overcrowded, so for managing them, pruning is necessary.  Pruning should be started when you plant the vine. For the first year, main focus should be on straight growth and strong framework instead of focusing on how to cut a kiwi. Tie the vine loosely to the pole and keep it growing upward in straight manner. Vines should not be curled around the pole. All side branches should be pruned until vine reaches the top of the pole. Cut the top part of the vine and promote side shoots to grow laterally along the wires in framework. For pruning, winter is the best time. If the vine doesn’t form good side branches at the top, then cut the main branch by nearly 2 feet and try to grow it and form proper side branches at the top again next year.<br><br>  
                            
                            <strong><i>6.<u>  Irrigation </u>:</i></strong><br>
                          
                            Irrigation should be provided in September-October month, when the fruit is in the initial stage of growing. Irrigation in 10-15 days of interval is beneficial for healthy growth of plant and fruits. 
                            
                            Intercropping of legumes and vegetables can be done with the kiwi plants. And one thing can be noted that, no serious pests or diseases are observed in the cultivation of Kiwi, just proper and regular care is sufficient.<br><br> 
                            
                            <strong><i>7.<u>   Harvesting </u>:</i></strong><br>                          
                          
                            After 4-5 years, kiwi plants start bearing fruits, but commercial production starts at 6-7 years’ age. At low altitudes, fruits mature faster than at high altitudes because of temperature difference. Large fruits are harvested first and smaller fruits are given some time to grow. Hard fruits are covered with a coarse cloth and transported to the market and after some days, i.e., 1-2 weeks, they become soft and edible.<br><br> 
                            
                            <strong><i>8.<u>Yielding</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            Yield rate of 50-100 kg per vine is observed in Kiwi plants.
