    <h1 style=" font-size: 60px; text-align: center; color:white;"><i>Yellow pigeon peas</i></h1>
     <p style="color:white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;">The pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), also known as arhar, tur,red gram, or gungo peas in Jamaica is a perennial legume from the family Fabaceae. Since its domestication in the Indian subcontinent at least 3,500 years ago, its seeds have become a common food in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is consumed on a large scale in South Asia and is a major source of protein for the population of the Indian subcontinent. It is the primary accompaniment to rice or roti (flat bread) and has the status of staple food throughout the length and breadth of India.</p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Yellow Pigeonpea is predominantly a crop of tropical areas mainly cultivated in semi arid regions of India.Yellow Pigeonpea can be grown with a temperature ranging from 260C to 300C in the rainy season (June to October) and 170C to 220C in the post rainy (November to March) season.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The saline-alkaline or waterlogged soils are unfit for Pigeon pea cultivation. It can grow successfully on soils having pH level ranges from 6.5 to 7.5. Light textured red soils to medium textured black soils are suitable for this cultivation.

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Place of cultivation:</i></strong></h3>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"> Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are major Pigeon pea producing states in India.</p>

    <div class="Pesticides">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Pesticides and fertilizers requirement:</i></strong></h3>   
         <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
         When different forms of N fertilizer, NaNO3, NH4C1, CO(NH2)2 and NH4NO3, were applied, urea performed best, both in terms of plant growth and yield. Plant growth and yield of pigeon pea increased with increasing K fertilizer up to 60 kg/ha; beyond this level, both plant growth and grain yield decreased.

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>      
         <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
         They are often sandy loam and can retain about 100 mm available water in the root profile (Reddy and Virmani 1981). Pigeonpea, being sensitive to water logging, requires a well-drained soil. It does not grow well in saline soil, but can withstand drought reasonably well.

        <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
      
        <strong><i><u>Land preparation</u></i></strong>:<br><br>
        Prepared land by taking one deep ploughing followed by two or three times harrowing. Planking should be followed after each ploughing. It cannot withstand in water logging conditions, prepared field in such a way that water stagnation should not take place.<br><br>


        <strong><i><u>Sowing</u></i></strong>:<br><br>
        <strong><i>Time of sowing</strong></i><br>
        Timely sowing of crop is important as delay in sowing leads to yield loss. Sow crop in second fortnight of May for obtaining high grain yield<br><br>

        <strong><i>Spacing:</i></strong> For sowing use spacing of 50 cm between the rows while 25 cm between the plant.<br>
        <strong><i>Sowing Depth:</i></strong> Seed are sown with help of seed drill at depth of about 7-10 cm.<br> 
        <strong><i>Method of sowing:</i></strong> Seeds can be sown by broadcasting method but line sowing with help of seed drill is more efficient way of sowing for good yield.<br><br>

        <strong><i><u>Chemical weed control</u></i></strong>:<br><br>

        Take one hoeing, about three weeks after sowing and another hoeing about six week after sowing. Apply Pendimethalin @ 1Ltr/acre in 150-200ltr of water as pre-emergence herbicide within 2 days after sowing, followed by hand weeding six to seven weeks after sowing.<br><br>

        <strong><i><u>Irrigation</u></i></strong>:<br><br>
        Three to four week after sowing apply first irrigation. Remaining irrigations are depends upon rainfall intensity. Flower initiation and pod setting stages are the most crucial to drought stress. Therefore, irrigation at these stages is essential for good yield. Avoid excessive irrigation as it leads to more vegetative growth and incidence of Phytophthora and alternaria blight. Do not apply irrigation after mid-September; it will affect maturity of crop.<br><br>

        <strong><i><u>Harvesting</u></i></strong>:<br><br>
        For vegetable purpose harvest plant when leaves and pods are of green color. For grain purpose, when 75-80% pods turn brown and dry, it is right time of harvesting. Delay in harvesting result in damage of seeds. Harvesting can be done manually by cutting stem or by Machine. After harvesting keep bundles of plant upright for drying purpose. Grains are removed from plant by threshing or by traditionally i.e beating plants with sticks.<br><br>

       <strong><i><u>Post-Harvest</u></i></strong>:<br><br>
        Grains of harvested crop must be well dried before storage. And take care to avoid the pulse beetle infestation in storage.
