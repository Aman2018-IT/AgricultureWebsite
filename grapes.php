            <p style="color:white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis.Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes or they can be used for making wine, jam, grape juice, jelly, grape seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil.</i></p>
        
        
    <div class="Weather">
        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Adequate sun, heat, and water during the growing season, and enough cold during the dormancy phase are crucial for healthy growth of vines and production of premium quality grapes. Grapevines thrive best in climates with long warm summers, and rainy winters. Warm weather during the growing period enables grapevine to flower, fruit set and ripen. On average, grapevines require about 1390 to +2220 growing degree days (temperatures above 10°C (50°F)) in order to ripe properly, depending on the growing region and vine variety. Grapevines also need water in order to thrive. In some areas and climates, there is more than enough rain for the vines to survive, while in other regions, vines needs to be irrigated. How much water grapevines need depends on several factors, such as climate, heat, soil, wine variety, etc. Apart from already mentioned climatic factors, also wind, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and sunlight have effect on grape growth.
               <br><br><i>Looking form the viticulture point, climate can be divided into three categories:<i>

                <br><strong>Macro-climate</strong>: this is the climate of a larger area, such as region or a country (most of the premium quality wines are grown in Mediterranean, martime, and continental climates)
                <br><strong>Meso-climate</strong>: this is a climate in a specific site determined by altitude, ocean proximity, prevailing winds, water, etc.
                <br><strong>Micro-climate</strong>: is a climate within the vineyard canopy on which winegrowers have the influence with vineyard management practices.

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The soil should be well drained, having good water holding capacity and devoid of any hard pan or impervious layer in the top 90-cm, with water table at least 6.5m below. Grapes can also be grown successfully over a wide range of soil pH (4.0-9.5) however, soils having pH range of 6.5-8.0 are considered ideal.

        </h3> 
                    <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">1.<u>Fungicides</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                        Black rot, downy mildew, powdery mildew, bitter rot, phomopsis and botrytis are among the most common and disastrous fungi that can destroy a grape harvest, the University of Purdue explained. 
                        
                        Purdue recommended spraying various chemical fungicides throughout the year to keep your grapes fugus-free. A broad-spectrum fungicide like mancozeb should be used early on in the season, when the vines first sprout. Throughout the season, while the plants are blooming, people should use strobilurins and sterol inhibitors, such as Nova, Rubigan, Bayleton, Abound, Sovran or Flint. 
                        
                        The rest of the year, Purdue suggested using products based on weather while also scouting for mildew incidents. 
                        
                        Meptyldinocap is a recent dinitrophenol fungicide that's an effective tool against mildew and mold on grapes and their vines as well as gourds and watermelons. Produced by Dow AgroSciences, this chemical is used all over the world to treat vines, including in the U.K. Although, it has not been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This fungicide is effective against powdery mildew. 
                        <br>
                        <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">2.<u>Insecticides</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                      
                        The Japanese beetle, grape berry moth, grape root borer, grape phylloxera and grape leafhopper are among the most damaging insects to grape plants. If you find a European grapevine moth, SF Gate recommended that you contact your local university for pet control assistance, typical pesticides may not work. Otherwise, there are plenty of insecticides designed for safe use on grapes. 
                        
                        Imidacloprid is one of the most common insecticide chemical compounds, with about half of all grapes having a trace of the popular insect neurotoxin. However, the Pesticide Action Network Pesticide Database explained that sulfur is the most used pesticide for fungus and insects. For example, in California in 2003, more than 20 million gross pounds of sulfur were used for grape pesticide. 
                        
                        There are a wide range of grape pesticides, however, including carbaryl, esfenvalerate, spinosad, permethrin, malathion and pyrethrin, SFGate pointed out. 
                        <br>
                        <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">3.<u>Herbicides</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                     
                        
                        Any plant that grows on a grapevine, other than grapes, is a weed, Purdue explained. This includes bushy perennials, grasses and broadleafs. Oryzalintrifluralin, simazine, norflurazon, diuron, oxyfluorfen, isoxaben and pendimethalin are among the best pre-emergence weed killers for grapevines. 
                        
                        Glyphosate, carfentrazone and glufosinate are broader spectrum weed killers that you can use throughout the year, Purdue explained. The university also emphasized a knowledge of pesticides and proper usage for maximum efficiency and minimal pollution.
                        <br>
                        <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">4.<u>Miticides</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                     
                        
                        SF Gate noted that in addition to insects, the European red mite, Willamette spider mite, Pacific spider mite and two-spotted spider mite can also wreak havoc on a vineyard. These tiny pests can discolor grapes and stunt shoot growth, as well as leave behind holes in the leaves and plenty of webbing. There are an array of ways to treat a mite problem though, SF Gate explained. 
                        
                        "Miticides used to combat mite problems include organic options such as soap and oil sprays as well as commercial products containing propargite, fenbutatin oxide, fenpyroximate, pyridaben or abamectin," the website outlined.

    <div class="Cultivation">
        <h3 style="font-size: 50px; color:white;">CULTIVATION-PROCESS</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:white;"><strong><u>Planting and Season</u>:</strong><br>
        Usually planting is done from October onwards till January. Rarely planting is also done during June-July where the monsoon is late. Monsoon planting is avoided mainly for avoiding diseases on young growth. For planting N-S direction the trenches are opened. The size of trench may be 60 to 75 cm. Deep wide. Then these trenches are filled with FYM, organic manures, 5:10:5 organic mixtures, single super phosphates, biofertilisers, neem cakes, etc. Spacing for planting is maintained depending on soil type, variety and method of training. The distance between two rows may be 2 to 3 m while distance between vines within a row will be half of that, accommodating vines from 2000 to 5000 per hectare.<br><br>

        <strong><u>Interculturing</u>:</strong><br>
        The following aspects are important:-<br>
        --> Gap filling: To be done preferably during one month after planting.<br>        
        --> Recut: Basal cut keeping 2/3 buds is taken one month after planting with an objective to get uniform new growth.<br>
        --> Supporting : The bamboo supports are fixed for vine support and young growing points are trained on them<br>
        --> Weeding: The vine rows are weeded out, twice/thrice depending on the intensity of weeds.<br>
        --> Irrigations – regular depending on soil and season are given.<br>
        --> Fertilizers are applied with cow during slurry to hasten the growth.<br>
        --> Suitable plant protection measures are following depending on incidence of pests and diseases.<br><br>
        
        <strong><u>Care of young orchard</u></strong>:
        Grapes vines takes about 1.5 to 2 years after planting to bear the first crop. During this period the care of young vines is taken as under:-<br>

        -->Training: The vines are trained first on bamboo and then on support – trellis. A suitable method of training is adopted.<br>
        -->Pruning – Initial pruning is done only for training i.e. for developing trunk, arm, fruiting, canes, etc.<br>
        -->The fertilizer doses – including organic, inorganic and bio-fertilizers are applied twice in a year.<br>
        -->Plant protection schedule is prepared and followed for the total initial period of growing.<br><br>
        
        <strong><i><u>Special Horticultural practices</u></i>:</strong><br><br>
        -->Pruning and training: The vines are trained on a suitable trellis i.e. ‘T’, ‘Y’, ‘H’ or bower and regularly pruned twice in a year. First annual pruning is done during the month of April to get the new vegetative growth while second pruning to get the crop is done during the month of October. While doing April pruning 0 to 2 buds on arm are kept while doing October pruning 5 to 10 buds on fruiting cane are kept. Use of HCN is done to have early, uniform and higher sprouting particularly after winter pruning is made.<br><br>

        --> Girdling: Vines are trunk girdled at bloom period to increase the fruit set, to increase the weight and T.S.S. and also to enhance maturity.<br><br>

        --> Use of hormones: The following plant hormones at various stages and concentrations are usually used to increase the yield and to improve the quality of bunches.<br>
                  1.At bloom………….GA3.. …20 to 30 ppm; CCC …500 ppm<br>
                  2.At setting…………GA3 ….30 to 40 ppm; 6BA….. 5-10 ppm<br>
                  3.At 4-6 mm size ….GA3 … 40 to 50 ppm; Brassinos...100 ppm<br>        
                  4.At 6-8 mm size … GA3 …30 to 50 ppm; Cppu…2-3 ppm<br><br>
        
        <strong><i><u>Irrigation</u></i>:</strong><br>
        Grape is strictly irrigated perennial crop and regularly irrigated. For flood irrigation, 5-7 days during summer 8-10 days during winter and 15-20 days during rainy season – interval is maintained while for drip irrigation, 40-50 L; 30-40, 20-30 L of water per day per vine, water is applied.<br><br>

        <strong><i><u>Nutrition</u></i>:</strong> <br>
        --> Balanced nutrition and use of chemical, organic and biofertilisers is essential to get a good crop of good quality every year. About 700 to 900 N, 400 to 600 P and 750 to 1000 K Kgs/ ha/year are applied to get about 30 to 35 tonnes produced yearly.<br>
        
        --> The use of vermiphos, biomeal, mixtures of 5:10:5 ormichem, micronutrient mixtures have proved useful in grape production. Fertilizers are applied mainly twice in a year at the time of pruning, besides occasional foliar sprays are also practiced. Now-a days, Fertigation techniques is being popular in grape growers.<br><br>

        <strong><i><u>Plant Protection</u></i>:</strong> <br>
        --> Grape shoots, leaves, blossoms and berries are attacked by many fungi and insect pests, besides some nematodes are also cause damage to roots.<br>
        --> Major fungal diseases – Anthracnose, Powdery mildew, Downy mildew, <br>
        --> Dead arm, Botraytis and Botrodiplodia.<br>
        --> Major bacterial diseases –Xyantomonas, blight.<br>
        --> Viral diseases – Fan leaf disease<br>
        --> Major Insect pests – Flea beetle, Mealy bug, Red mite, Thrips, caterpillars.<br>
        --> Soil born pests – Nematodes, phyloxere, white ants, and white grub.<br>
        --> Control measures: A number of systemic and contact fungicides and pesticides are available and are to be used as per following local schedule.<br>
        --> Besides pests and diseases the crop is to be protected against weeds, Cyprus, doob grass, Parthenium olerace are some of the common and important weeds found in vineyards. They are controlled by frequent weeding fruit ching/growing cover crops or by using chemical weedicides as Gramaxone, Basaline, Roundup, Glycel, etc.<br>
        --> Grape bunches are also to be protected against hot sun, Cold wave, dry air spell, Dew and Storm. Some chemical some physiological and some mechanical means methods are adopted.<br><br>

        <strong><i><u>Harvesting and Yields</u></i>:</strong><br>  
        --> Normal grape harvest season starts in February and continuous up to end of April. Well matured bunches having at least 180 Brix are harvested<br>
        -->Av. yields - For seedless varieties - 20 to 30 t/ha/y<br>
        --> For seeded varieties - 40 to 50 t/ha/y<br><br>

        <strong><i><u>Post Harvest handling</u></i>:</strong><br>
        -->Harvested grapes are packed in 2 to 4 kg-corrugated boxes. Grape guards, pouches are kept inside the boxes for distant markets. Pre-cooling and use of grape guards are the musts for cold storage and export markets.<br>
        -->Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Ahmedabad, Ludhiana, Patna, Jamshedpur, Bangalore, Hyderabad, are the main market places in the country.<br><br>

        <strong><u>Some additional Features</u>:</strong> <br>
        --> Export: Day by day increased quantities are exported to Europe, Middle East, Dubai, etc.<br>
        --> Winemaking: Wine making and champagne making are profitable and started at few places in Maharashtra and Karnataka.<br>
        --> Raisin making: A good quality black and golden raisins are prepared from the varieties. The raisins are increasing demand from Indian as well as from outside countries.
