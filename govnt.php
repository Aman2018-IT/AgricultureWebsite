    <br><h3>1.Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)</h3>
    <br><p>The extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods and hailstorms cause crop failures and financial loss to the farmers every year. And therefore, to save them from these ill effects, the Government, by merging all previous crop insurance schemes, launched Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) from Kharif 2016 season with the aim to support production in agriculture by providing an affordable crop insurance system.<br>

    Central government has made Aadhaar mandatory for availing crop insurance from Kharif 2017 season. The scheme has been restructured with states given option to determine scale of finance at district level as per average yield.<br><br>

    <br><h3>2.National Mission For Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)</h3>
    <br><p>In order to make agriculture more productive, sustainable, remunerative and climate resilient, the Government of India introduced National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) in the year 2014-15. To achieve these goals, the mission promotes location specific sustainable and best farming practices; soil conservation and moisture protection measures; soil nutrient management; efficient and sustainable water management practices with mainstreaming rainfed methods.

    As a major component of the mission, ‘On Farm Water Management’ (OFWM) is being implemented with the objective of increasing water use efficiency by promoting modern technologies such as micro irrigation and sustainable water management practices, efficient water consumption, better distribution channels along with secondary storage facilities. <br><br>

    <br><h3>4.Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) </h3>
    <br><p>Parampragat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) is one of the important government schemes which encourages farmers for traditional and organic farming in India. Under the scheme, the Government of India provides a financial assistance to the farmers of Rs 50,000 per hectare every three years for organic inputs, certification, labelling, packaging, transportation and marketing of organic produce. The scheme focuses on reducing the ill effects of overuse of fertilisers and agrochemicals by promoting organic manures, bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides. It helps improve the soil fertility by improving organic carbon in the soil which results in enhancing moisture holding capacity in the field too. <br><br>

    <br><h3>9. Soil Health Card</h3>
    <br><p>With an objective of conserving and maintaining soil nutrient and soil fertility, Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme issues soil health cards to the farmers every two years to provide a basis to address nutritional deficiencies in the fields. Under the scheme, soil testing is conducted to analyse the nutrient needs, then crop-wise fertilisers are recommended accordingly. This reduces cultivation cost by application of right fertilisers with right quantity. <br>

    In the next five years, the Centre has targeted to cover 400,000 villages under individual farm holding soil sampling and testing, organise 2.5 lakh demonstrations, set up of 250 village level soil testing labs, strengthening 200 soil testing labs and promotion of micro-nutrients in two lakh hectare area.<br><br>
