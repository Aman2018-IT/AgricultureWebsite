>>The word pulse originates directly from the Latin puls meaning "thick gruel, porridge, mush.‚Äù<br>
	>>Humans have relied on pulses for centuries. Archaeological remains found in modern day Turkey indicate that farmers grew chickpeas and lentils as far back as 7000 - 8000 B.C.
	<br>
	>>The most widely cultivated pulses in Africa include common beans, pigeon pea, cowpea, groundnuts, chickpea and soybean.
	<br>
	>>It takes just 43 gallons of water to produce one pound of pulses, compared with 216 for soybeans and 368 for peanuts.<br>
	>>As nitrogen-fixing crops, pulses actually enrich soils rather than deplete them of nutrients during the growing process.<br>
	
	>>Pulses help to improve food security because as dried seeds, they can be stored for a long period of time without a decrease in nutrition.
	<br>
	>>Pulses are drought-tolerant and hardy under frost conditions, making them suitable to a wide range of environments.
	<br>
	>>Pulses are good sources of protein, fiber, and folate as well as calcium, iron, lysine, and vitamin C.<br>
	>>Pulses contribute about 10 percent of protein intake and 5 percent of energy intake in low-income countries.<br>
	>>Pulses are extremely beneficial for women and children because folate is a key nutrient during periods of rapid growth, such as pregnancy and infancy.
