            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>A plum is a sweet fruit that grows on a plum tree. The scientific name for the tree is Prunus domestica. When the fruit is dried, it is called a prune. The color "plum" takes its name from the fruit.
            </i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">It requires less chilling hours that is temperature below 7.2°C. It can tolerate frost and high summers both, that is why it can be cultivated in both low temperature to 0°C and up, highest up to 47°C in summers. Some cultivars like Santa Rosa can only be cultivated in higher hills (700-1000 chilling hours) but low chilling requiring cultivators (250-300 chilling hours) are preferred for plains.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Plum is performing very well in soils with high pH where peach fails. That is why it is preferred as filler over peach. For good performance of trees well drained sandy loam to medium loam soils are most suited. Root stock plays a major role in the preference of soil. Own rooted plum cuttings and Kabul Green Gage plum rootstock prefer heavy soils, where as plum propagated on peach do well in sandy loams. Plum propagated on peach should not be planted as filler in Litchi orchards, because of high water requirements of litchi plants.</p>

    <div class="Place">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Place of cultivation:</i></strong></h3>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">In north India high quality plum is being grown in hilly area of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashinir, Uttrakhand and Uttar Pradesh. In the plains low chilling requiring plum cultivars are cultivated throughout Punjab, Haryana and in some parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.</p>

    <div class="Pesticides">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Pesticides requirement:</i></strong></h3>
            
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Normally in Plum farming, Sandy soils require more amount fertilizers than heavy soil types. 60 kg urea (30 g N), a dose of 6 kg farm yard manure (F.M.Y), 95gramsof super phosphate (15grams P2 O5 ) and 60 grams of potash (36grams K2O) per year age of the tree is optimum to meet the nutrient requirement of plum.</p>

    <div class="Water">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Frequent irrigation at weekly interval may be applied during April, May and June. No irrigation at full bloom stage and the ripening stage be given to avoid flower and fruit drop. During rainy season no irrigation is required. The interval may increase to 20 days in September, October and November.

        <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Plum varieties developed in India are of Japanese origin and belong to the Prunus salicina group. Plums grown in India require less chilling hours and have the best taste and can be consumed fresh unlike others. Few of the varieties include Kala Amritsari, Satluj Purple, Titron, Kataru Chak.

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>1.<u>Propagation</u>:</i></strong><br><br>
                            a.<u>Through Cuttings</u>:<br>

                            Usually plums are propagated through of hard wood cuttings. Kala Amritsari is also propagated through hard wood cuttings. Cutting of Kabul Green Gage can also be used for grafting of other plum cultivars. The rooting percentage of cuttings can be increased by dipping the cuttings lower ends for 24 hours in 100 ppm of IB A solution before planting during December.
                            
                            Other cultivars can be grafted on to the cuttings of Kala Amritsari during December. Dissolve l00mg of IBA in 20ml of absolute alcohol and make the volume one litre. The success of these grafts ranges between 70-80 percent. Though grafts which fail to sprout can be regrafted on to the shoots developed from the rooted cutting next winter. The thickness of cutting should not be more than pencil thickness and length normally 18 to 20cm. simultaneously grafted and rooted cuttings/grafts get ready for planting in the next winter.<br><br>
                            
                            b.<u>Through Seed</u>:<br>
                            
                            Plum stones from the ripe Kala Amritsari fruits are extracted during May. These stones are properly washed to remove pulp and stored after room drying in gunny bags in shade. The seeds are sown in lines in the nursery during November. The seeds are covered with 4-5cm thick layer of sand.
                            
                            This will be sufficient to stratify the seed in field and seed will start germinating. Alternately the seeds can be stratified in wooden boxes as in peach and kainth seeds. Stratification is complete when the plumule emerges out from the stones of the upper layer of stones in the box.
                            The emerging seedlings from the stones are gently collected and sown in lines 30cm apart at a distance of 10cm. Leave a gap of 45cm after transplanting four rows: Thereafter light irrigation through flooding should be given. These seedlings get ready for grafting within a year.<br><br>
                            

                        <strong><i>2.<u> Planting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                        Plum plants in the nursery shed their leaves in January. Hence, these are uprooted along with the roots and can be transported long distances bate rooted. While planting the plants in the prepared pits, the lowermost branches should be removed. Keep only 3-4 side branches and clip the tops of all shoots so that secondary branching could be initiated. Place in the small pit all the roots and put soil to cover the roots to the soil level.<br>
                         
                        Press the soil around the newly planted plants gently. Apply light irrigation to the plants so that soil settles down. Level the soil at ‘wattar’ condition. Continue to apply light and frequent irrigation till rainy season.<br>
                        
                        Apply 10ml of chloropyriphos in one litre of water to each plant in the root zone 20 days after planting for the control of white ants. The plants getting tilted with first irrigation should be straightened and root zone repressed.<br>
                        
                        Normally plums are planted as fillers; hence planting distance shall be according to the main fruit crop. This may vary from 3.5 to 5.0 m. However, if pure plum orchard is to be planted, then a spacing of 6m X 6m is enough, which will accommodate 256 plants in square system and 305 in hexagonal system of planting per hectare.<br><br>
                        

                       <strong><i>3.<u>Training and Pruining</u>:</i></strong><br>
                       Plum trees should be trained according to modified leader system. If healthy plants with some scafforlds selected at the time of planting are planted, the training can be completed in two years. Otherwise, the training is completed in 3 years from planting. The top growing shoot is headed back at planting time at a height of 90cm. The scaffolds selected at a height of 40cm and above are also headed back in January to get branching.<br>
                       
                       The plants sprout in February and continue to produce sufficient growth during summer until October. One should continue to select side branches during the growing period which will provide a healthy scaffold system within two years. In all, select 4-5 scaffolds all around the trunk.

                       During the first two years selection of secondary branches on the scaffolds is also carried out. In the third year the top growing leader should be removed from a point of our growing scaffold, during January. Thin out some of the side branches and cris-crossing shoots. The small spurs formed during these years on shoots start flowering. Water shoots sprouting on the main trunk should be removed immediately. <br>
                       
                    
                       Plums bear on one year old shoots and short spurs depending upon the nature of cultivar. Normally no pruning may be given in the first year of bearing. Remove only cris- crossing shoots and water shoots. Do not too open the tree from inside in the first year of bearing.Do not too open the tree from in side, let the thin branches have leaves which contribute toward the maturity of other shoots and spurs.<br>
                         
                        A little pruning to the out growing branches may be done in fifth year onward. The severity of pruning depends upon the planting distance. When plum is planted as filler in pear it may require early severe pruning due to lesser planting distance than in litchi and mango. The cuts may be treated with Bordeaux paste/paint.<br><br>
                       

                        <strong><i>4.<u>Flowering and Fruiting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                        Flowering in plum cultivars usually take place in the second half of February in the north India plains. Plum flower profusely hence there are sufficient number of hermaphrodite flowers to set fruit. Usually there is very heavy fruit set in plums. However, it is cultivar dependent. For example Kala Amritsar is heavy bearer but Alubokhara shy bearer.

                        Plum follows a double sigmoid curve of fruit growth. Immature fruits are very acidic. As the fruit mature the acidity start decreasing and TSS goes on increasing. Simultaneously the skin colour specific of cultivar start developing.
                        <br><br>

                       <strong><i>5.<u>Irrigation</u>:</i></strong><br>Plums are shallow rooted and fast growing plants hence need sufficient moisture during growing period. Interval of irrigation may depend upon many factors such as soil type, climate and kind of main fruit trees. Frequent irrigation at weekly interval may be applied during April, May and June. No irrigation at full bloom stage and the ripening stage be given to avoid flower and fruit drop. During rainy season no irrigation is required. The interval may increase to 20 days in September, October and November. There should be no irrigation given during December and January months.
                       <br><br>

                       <strong><i>6.<u>Intercropping</u>:</i></strong><br>In solid block of plums inter crops can be grown for the first five years. If the plum is planted as filler then there is little space left for growing of crops. Hence inner-crops can only be grown for 1-2 years. The legumes like peas, grams, moong or vegetables should be grown with caution. Water needs of inter­crops should be such that also favour plum growth and fruiting.
                       <br><br>

                       <strong><i>7.<u>Weed-Control and Thinning of fruits</u>:</i></strong><br><br>
                       Weed Control:<br>
                       In plum orchards several weeds come up. Weeds particularly motha, Khabal grass, baru grass, parthenium and dab are found in abundance. Weeds may be removed from plant basins by hoeing. Weeds from the vacant space may be controlled by spraying Round up (Glyphosate) @ 10 ml/litre and when required particularly during the rainy season.
                       <br><br>
                       Thinning of Fruits:<br>
                       Generally plums set fruit much more than it is capable of maturing. Excessive fruit set in plums results in to smaller fruits, which fetch poor price in the market. Kala Amritsari needs thinning of fruits to improve in size. Plum should be thinned immediately after natural fruit drop in April. Hand thinning is usually done from top of the shoot to bottom. Fruits are kept at 5-6 cm apart there should be 15-20 leaves for a fruit. There should not be two fruits at one point.
                       <br><br>

                       <strong><i>8.<u>Fruit Harvesting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                       The plum fruits are mature when these have attained proper size and developed proper colour depending upon the cultivar. The plum fruits are harvested from second week of May in Punjab. For local marketing fruits should be harvested when ripe and firm. For distant markets, fruits are picked when firm but have developed 50% colour on the skin. Plum should be harvested along with pedicels avoiding any injury to the fruit.

                       Plum fruit is very perishable in nature, hence should be handled with care. The small baskets should be padded with rice trash or grass at the bottom and sides. Freshly harvested fruits are transferred in these baskets and covered with paper and tied in guny cloth.
                       
                       The fruits should be graded before packing in basket or wooden boxes. Several pickings are made as the entire fruit on a tree do not ripen at one time. Fruit is borne on spurs also so care should be taken to the save the spurs from breakage, during harvesting.
