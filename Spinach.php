            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Spinach (पालक) belongs to family of "Amaranthaceae" and it is native of central and western Asia. It is perennial vegetable and cultivated throughout the world. Spinach is also known as "Palak" in Hindi .</i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">It can be grown on any type of soil having good drainage capacity. But it give good result when grown on sandy loam and alluvial soil. Avoid acidic soils also water logged soils for spinach cultivation. pH of soil should be in range of 6 to 7.</p>

                        The plant can grow well in partial or full sun, but at least four hours of sunlight is ideal for it to grow more leaves. Maintain the soil moist by regular watering. Water deeply to make sure the deepest roots are reached. Daily watering is required during the hot and dry summer months.

                            Soil should be prepared by ploughing 2-3 times. After ploughing do levelling of soil for uniform bed formation. Prepared bed and irrigation channels.
                            <strong> Time of sowing  </strong>  <br><br>
                            Spinach is sown throughout the year. For winter season, best time for sowing is from September to October. For spring season complete sowing from Mid-February to April.<br><br>

                          

                             
                             <strong>Spacing</strong>
                             Use row to row spacing of 25-30 cm and plant to plant spacing of 5-10 cm.
 <br><br>

                              <strong>Sowing Depth : </strong> 
                              Sow seeds at depth of 3-4 cm.<br><br>

                             <strong>Method of Sowing : </strong> 
                             Sowing can be done by line sowing and broadcasting method.

                            For good yield, apply well decomposed cowdung@100 qtl and Nitrogen@35 kg (in form of Urea@75 kg), Phosphorus@12 kg (in form of Superphosphate@75 kg) per acre. Apply whole amount of well decomposed cowdung and phosphorus along with half amount of nitrogen before sowing. Apply remaining amount of nitrogen in two equal splits after each cutting. After fertilizer application provide light irrigation. <br><br>

                                <strong><i>3.<u>Irrigation</u>:</i></strong><br>
                                For proper seed germination and good growth soil should have enough moisture content. At time of sowing if proper soil moisture is not present in soil then provide pre-sowing irrigation.
                                First irrigation should be given after sowing. In summer month, apply irrigation at interval of 4-6 days where as in winter month apply irrigation at interval of 10-12 days. Avoid over irrigation also care should be taken not to water on leaves, as it will leads to occurrence of disease and deterioration of quality. Drip irrigation is proves to be beneficial for spinach cultivation.
