        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Litchi performs well under humid conditions in subtropical climate. The fruit size and other fruit development characters are greatly affected by the humidity in the atmosphere. ... Summer temperature more than 42°C is harmful for litchi trees. Severe fruit cracking and sun burning of fruit take place in severe summers.</p>

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Litchi is a sub-tropical fruit and thrives best under moist sub-tropical climate. It usually prefers low elevation and can be grown up to an altitude of 800 m. (m.s.l.). Deep, well drained loamy soil, rich in organic matter and having pH in the range of 5.0 to 7.0 is ideal for the crop.</p>

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Once the fruit setting is over and fruits attain 1 cm size, watering is done at the rate of 1350 litres per tree per week (Table 10.3). There are four main methods to apply water to the litchi plants:<br>
                         (1) <u>Surface irrigation</u>:
                          It is where water is applied and distributed over the soil surface by gravity. It is by far the most common form of irrigation throughout the world and has been practiced in many areas virtually unchanged for thousands of years.
                         <br><br>
                         (2) <u>Sprinkle irrigation</u>:
                         It is a method of applying irrigation water which is similar to natural rainfall. Water is distributed through a system of pipes usually by pumping. It is then sprayed into the air through sprinklers so that it breaks up into small water drops which fall to the ground.<br><br>
                          
                         (3) <u>Drip irrigation</u>:
                         is a type of micro-irrigation system that has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either from above the soil surface or buried below the surface. The goal is to place water directly into the root zone and minimize evaporation.
                        
                         (4) <u>Sub-irrigation</u>:
                         Also known as seepage irrigation, is a method of irrigation where water is delivered to the plant root zone. The excess may be collected for reuse. <br><br>

                            <strong><u>Propagation</u>:</strong><br>
                            --><u>Vegetative Propagation</u>:<br>
                            Litchi is commercially propagated through air layering. For this purpose, straight growing, one year old shoots are selected. A 3cm, ring of bark 30-40cm from the apex of shoots is removed during August. Moist sphagnum moss is wrapped around the ringed portion and a part of shoot.
                            
                            The moss is covered with polythene. The roots can be seen from the transparent polythene. The air layers (gootee) are removed from the parent plant during October and planted in the nursery for one to two years before actually planting in the field. After transplanting the air layers, the beds are kept in moist condition with light irrigation.
                               
                            While handling the air layers care should be taken to provide support of hand to the roots in the moss grass. The nursery beds should be provided sarkanda shelter during winter to protect the litchi plants from frost damage. For better transportation and easy handling during planting, the air layers can be planted in polythene bags.
                            
                            The polythene bags of size 20cm wide and 30cm in length should be filled with a mixture of FYM and soil in the ratio of 50: 50. The air layers are planted in this mixture and kept moist. It is easy to keep, these bags under net or shade or under a big litchi tree to protect it from frost and high temperature in summer. The plants in bags get better care than in field. It is easy to handle bags than earth balls in the field also. The chance of death of the plant at planting time is also rare as compared to earth balls.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            <strong><u>Planting and after Care</u>:</strong><br>
                            The planting of litchi should be preferred during September-October. However, in the lower hills where rains continue up to August end planting can be advanced to end July. Two years old plants in the nursery should be preferred over one year old. The mild temperature with humidity during October and November help in the establishment of litchi plants better than those planted in July-August. Plants should not be planted too deep in the pits. Deep planted plants do not perform well.
                            
                            Litchi is generally planted at 8 to 9 metres apart in a square system. Thus 144-121 plants can be accommodated in one hectare. For planting on hexagonal system litchi should be planted at 10m x 10m, which require 105 plants per hectare. The pits should be prepared two months prior to planting. One metre deep and one metre diameter pits should be dug. Keep top half of soil on one side and lower half on the other.
                            
                            Mix farm yard manure 25kg well with the top soil and fill the pits 5cm above soil level. Apply two litres of Dursban 20EC (chloropyriphos) solution @ l0ml/litre of water to the filled pit. Apply irrigation to settle down the soil in pit. At the time of planting lift some soil from the centre of the pit with the help of a planting board and place the earth ball in the hole. Level the soil around the plant. It is preferable to use soil from a litchi orchard for leveling of the hole of newly-planted plant. This will help in the fast growth of newly-planted plants due to the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. Apply irrigation soon after planting.
                            <br><br>

                            <strong><u>Wind Break</u>:</strong><br>
                            It is very essential to save the litchi plants from the high velocity hot winds which can break the litchi plants or desiccate the foliage. So, plant a wind break by planting Jamun, Mango seeding or Arjuna interplanted with mulberry and other shrubs like bouganvillea around the litchi orchards two to three years ahead of litchi planting. A 1.5m deep trench should be dug at 1.5 to 2.0m away from the wind break so that roots of wind break do not compete with litchi roots for nutrition.
                            <br><br>

                            <strong><u>Protection to Young Plant</u>:</strong><br>
                            The establishment of litchi orchard is little difficult job. The mortality of newly-planted is so high in the early years that one can see a few established plants in an orchard. Farmers start growing annual crops again. For saving the young plants mulching should be done immediately after planting.
                            
                            White ants attack should be checked by applying chloropyriphos solution-twice @ l0ml/litre in November and then in March every year for three years. For producing shade and checking the effect of high velocity winds grow ‘arhar’ all around the plants at a distance of 1m. The same ‘arhar’ plants can be used to provide shelter during winter. The southern side of the basin should be kept open by uprooting some arhar plants. Arhar may be uprooted in the third year and if needed the re-sowing may be carried out at a distance of to 1.5m so that arthar roots may not interfere with litchi roots.
                            <br><br>

                            <strong><u>Training and Pruning</u>:</strong><br>
                            No prunings is done for the first two years. Remove only the lower most branches upto height of 50 cm. The removal of branches should be staggered through out for 3-4 years after planting. Keep sufficient number of leaves in the first year so that plants have profuse growth. Do not allow any branch to criss-cross or to grow inward.
                            
                            Litchi plants take the shape of an umbrella of its own but very slowly. Training should be done on modified leads system of training which is completed after 3 or year of planting. Trees come into bearing in year of planting depending on the cultivar and plant vigour. New growth automatically take place when a small part of shoot bearing fruit pancile is also removed during fruit harvesting.
                            <br><br>

                            <strong><u>Rejuvenation</u>:</strong><br>
                            When trees become too old and branches start interming­ling, the yield decreases due to over crowding and lack of aeration and sun shine. At this stage the trees should be rejuvenated. The main scaffolds are headed back to keep 30cm of stubs during January just like in mango and pear. Keep only 5-6 scaffold stubs per tree.
                            
                            Top most scaffolds should be removed to bring the height of the rejuvenated tree down. Many sprouts come up on the stubs. Select 2-3 out growing shoots per stub. Thus there will be 10-12 branches per tree. The profuse growth in the first year it self-produces healthy trees again within 2-3 years of rejuvenation. These trees can yield good crop for a number of years again.

                            Sufficient soil moisture is a prerequisite for profuse growth and good fruiting in litichi. During rains no irrigation may be given. Shortage of moisture in soil adversely affect the growth of trees. Young as well as bearing trees need frequent irrigations. The plants should be irrigated after 4-5 days during hot months and interval may be increased to 7-10 days as the temperature falls.
                            
                            No irrigation should be given in October and November. From December to February irrigation may be given at an internal of 20-30 days depending upon the winter rains. No irrigation is given at full bloom stage which normally comes in mid March to mid April depending upon the cultivar under Punjab conditions. During the fruit development period, i.e., May and June irrigation may be given at an interval of 4-5 days. Sufficient moisture in soil reduce the cracking of fruit. Young trees should be irrigated through modified basin system of irrigation.
                            
                            The basin should be gradually increased as the plants spread. Mature bearing trees should be irrigated through flooding of small segments. Each segment may including 4-6 trees. In such a way sufficient water will be made available to the trees. Much of the water will be saved which otherwise would be needed for flooding of an acre, hectare or more as one segment. Growing of ‘moth’, cowpeas as cover crop in basins shall help in the fast growth of litchi plants.<br><br>
                            

                            <strong><u>Manuring and Fertilization</u>:</strong><br>
                            Litchi plants require sufficient organic matter for their roots to spread and make good growth of the foliage. The early profuse growth is required to reduce the juvenile period and for getting high early fruit yield. To obtain and maintain this growth sufficient N, P and K is required as nutrition.
                            
                            Nitrogen deficient plants grow slowly and have light green foliage which may turn yellow soon. Old leaves show yellowing earlier than the new ones. Phosphorus and potassium deficient plants show stunting of plant and scorching of old leaves. A healthy litchi plant should take 3-4 flushes in a year. Following fertilizer schedule is being recommended.
                        
                            
                            Farm yard manure, super phosphate and Muriate of Potash should be applied in December under the tree canopy uniformly and should be mixed well with soil. Urea should be split into tree equal parts for the first three years of age.
                            
                            After that it may be applied in two equal parts. Apply urea in February; April and June to the young plants and in February and April to the bearing plants. In off year, non-bearing plants may not be given phosphorous and potash fertilizers and quantity of urea should also be halved.<br><br>
                            

                            <strong><u>Mircronutrient Deficiencies</u>:</strong><br>
                            Deficiency of Zinc, Iron and Manganese has been noticed in both young and bearing litchi plants. Therefore, in addition to the above fertilization, mixture of Zinc Sulphate plus Ferrous Sulphate @ 2 gm/litre should be sprayed during April. In May Zinc Sulphate + Manganese Sulphate should be sprayed @ 2gm/ litre of water. These chemicals should be of laboratory grade. Such a light spray shall not bring other mircronutrient deficiencies.
                            <br><br>

                            <strong><u>Intercropping</u>:</strong><br>
                            Litchi takes 6-7 years to yield a commercial crop. Moreover due to slow growth and more planting distance, sufficient vacant space is available for the first 3-4 year. This vacant space should be judiciously utilized by growing intercrops. Fruit plants with less juvenile period as kinnow, guava, peach or plum can be planted as fillers in litchi orchards. Vegetables can also be’ profitably grown for 3-4 years.
                            
                            Pulses add nitrogen to the soil and give high returns. These should be preferred over growing of wheat or fodder crops. The fillers should be removed before these start interfering with the litchi plants. The nutritional requirements of crops, vegetables and filler plants should be separately attended to. If wheat is grown then keep a separate irrigation system for litchi plants so that plants should not suffer during March-April for want of irrigation.<br><br>
                            

                            <strong><u>Fruit Drop</u>:</strong><br>
                            It seems, fruit drop in litchi occurs due to failure of fertilization of the ovule since the drop occurs just after fruit set. The maximum drop has been recorded in Dehradun followed by Muzzaffurpur and Calcutta. The micronutrient sprays recommended effectively reduced, the fruit drop in Dehradun cultivar. Growth regulator like GA2 @ 40 ppm spray at full bloom stage can check fruit drop.<br><br>
                            
                            <strong><u>Harvesting and Handling of Fruits</u>:</strong><br>
                            The litchi plants start bearing after fifth year of planting and the yield continue to increase with the increase in tree size up to 20 years of age. Litchi cultivars start ripening of fruit as early as June as in Dehradun and continue up to July as in Calcutta. The fully mature and ripe fruits should be harvested since no improvement in fruit quality take place after the fruit:
                            is harvested. The fruit should be harvested when a represen­tative colour on the epicarp (Skin) characteristic of the cultivar has developed and finely pointed tubercles on the skin have flattened/smoothened.
                            
                            While harvesting whole of the cluster along with 15-20cm of leafy branch should be cut with a sharp secateurs. The presence of foliage will help the fruit to escape wilting. Three to four pickings are made per tree to fully harvest the trees since all the clusters do not ripen at one time. The harvested fruit is kept in shade to maintain freshness. <br><br>
                           
                           
                            <strong><u>Grading, Packing and Marketing</u>:</strong><br>
                            Litchi clusters should be graded as excellent, poor clusters and single fruits separately. The packing is done in small baskets by placing sufficient foliage under the clusters and covering with newspaper and litchi leaves for local market. However, for distant market small wooden boxes are used to pack the litchi fruit. For fancy litchi fruits can be packed in 500 gm transparent packs without using any foliage or paper as cushion.
                            
                            Since, litchi fruit looses its freshness soon after harvest thus the packed material should be transported to distant market as soon as possible. During transit avoid crushing of fruit in packs. Growers can earn upto rupees 70,000 per acre if marketing is properly done.<br><br>
                            
                           
                            <strong><u>Storage</u>:</strong><br>
                            Normally litchi is consumed as fresh fruit. At ordinary temperature it can not be kept for more than two days. After that the epicarp looses its original colour become hard just like shell of an egg. The fruit can be stored for a few days in the fresh form. The most important character is to retain the colour of skin in the cold store.
                            
                            The phased marketing of the fruit form cold store shall add more income to the grower since, no other fruit can replace litchi and mango. Litchi fruit treated with 6 percent wax emulsion can be stored in perforated polyethylene bags of 100 gauge thickness in a commercial cold storage (2.2°- 3.3°C) and RH 90-95 percent for one month.
