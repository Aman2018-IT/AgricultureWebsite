            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.</i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The ideal climate for rose growing should have temperature with a minimum of 15°C and maximum of 28°C. Light is important factor which decides the growth. The growth is slowed by day length, i.e.  12 hours and heavy overcast, cloudy/mist conditions. High relative humidity exposes the plant to serious fungal diseases.</p>

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The soil pH of 6.0 to 7.5 is ideal for rose cultivation. Rose is very sensitive to saline soils as sodium carbonate which is present in the saline soil is harmful to the plants. Soils rich in organic matter with good water holding capacity are ideal for its cultivation.
