                                After sowing, apply first irrigation, it will help in good germination. Depending upon soil type and climate, apply remaining irrigations at interval of 6-7days in summer and 10-12 days interval in winter month. Overall radish required five to six irrigations. Avoid excessive irrigation as it will leads misshape of roots and numerous hair growth. In summer season, provide pre-harvest light irrigation. It will keep root fresh and reduce pungency.

                                Aphid: Serious pest of Radish, attacked at seedling as well as at maturity stage. If infestation is observed, spraying of Malathion 50EC@1ml/Litre of water should be done. Repeat spray for two-three times at interval of 10days. <br><br>

                                     Alternaria blight: Slightly raised, yellow spots are observed on leaves. Infection is rapidly spread in rainy season. Fungus spread on pods and seeds loose viability.
                                       If infestation is observed, spraying of Mancozeb@2gm/lit of water or Carbendazim@1gm/lit of water should be done to control this disease.
