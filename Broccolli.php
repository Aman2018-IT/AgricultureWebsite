            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Broccoli ( ब्रोकली )is an exotic vegetable. Broccoli farming is a good source of income because only a few farmers know how to grow broccoli and its marketing knowledge.Broccoli is a sun-loving, cool-season crop that is best grown in the chillier weather of spring or fall. It’s also incredibly good for you and has been dubbed the “crown jewel of nutrition.” Here’s how to plant, grow, and harvest broccoli in your garden</i></p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"> 1.Broccoli is cool-season crop, so it should be started in late winter or early spring (depending on your climate) for an early summer crop, or in mid- to late summer for a fall crop. High temperatures will affect development of the broccoli head (the harvestable part), so the goal is to get broccoli to mature before or after high temperatures are expected. <br> <br> 
             2. Broccoli seeds are capable of germinating in soil temperatures as low as 40°F (4°C), but warmer soil is preferred and will greatly speed up development.
             <br> <br>
             3.For spring plantings, broccoli may be started indoors or outdoors a few weeks ahead of your last spring frost date. Consult our Planting Calendar to see recommended dates for your area. Generally speaking: <br>

             * Start seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before your last frost date. <br>
             * Sow seeds outdoors 2 to 3 weeks before your last frost date, or as soon as the soil can be worked in the spring.<br> <br>
             4.For fall plantings (best in warm climates), sow seeds outdoors 85 to 100 days before the first fall frost, when soil and ambient temperatures are high.

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">  1.  Broccoli requires a site with exposure to full sun (6 to 8 hours per day). Lack of sunlight may produce thin, leggy plants and subpar heads. <br>
                2.Plant in a bed of moist, fertile soil that drains well.<br>
                3. Soil pH should be slightly acidic, between 6.0 and 7.0.<br>
                4. To increase fertility before you plant, in early spring, work in 2 to 4 inches of rich compost or a thin layer of manure. (Learn more about soil amendments and preparing soil for planting).

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
                Major broccoli producing growing states of India are West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Jharkhand. </p>

                        1.Aphids: Curling leaves may mean that the plant’s sap is being sucked by insects. Apply soapy water to all sides of leaves whenever you see aphids. <br> <br>
                        2.Cabbage loopers: Small holes on the leaves between the veins mean small green caterpillars are present. Look at the undersides of the leaves. Hand pick if the problem is small or control with Bacillus thuringiensis, a natural, bacterial pesticide. Use a floating row cover just after planting through harvest to prevent caterpillars. <br><br>
                        3. Cabbage root maggots <br> <br>
                        4. Cabbageworms and other worm pests: Treat same as loopers. <br> <br>
                        5.Clubroot: Quickly wilting plants may be due to this fungus in the soil. The entire plant, including all roots and root tendrils, must be gently dug up and removed. If the roots are gnarled and misshapen, then clubroot is the problem. Act quickly to remove the plants so that the fungus doesn’t continue to live in the soil. Do not compost the plants. Raise the pH of your soil to above 7.2. You may need to sterilize your soil, too. <br> <br>
                       6. Downy Mildew: Yellow patches on leaves are usually caused by moist weather. Keep leaves as dry as possible with good air circulation. Buy resistant varieties. <br> <br>
                       7. White rust <br> <br>
                       8. Whiteflies <br> <br>
                        9.Nitrogen deficiency: If the bottom leaves turn yellow and the problem continues toward the top of the plant, the plants need a high nitrogen (but low phosphorus) fertilizer or blood meal. Blood meal is a quick nitrogen fix for yellowing leaves. <br> <br>

                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">For the Broccoli crop, drip irrigation is very beneficial. It improves crop yields and quality. <br> <br>

                        Light and frequent irrigation should be given after  10-15 days intervals depending on weather conditions and maintain soil moisture around the root zone.

                            Broccoli can be grown in a wide variety of soils type. To get a better yield from the broccoli crop, sandy and silt loam soils are most preferred. The soil PH should be between  5.5 pH – 6.5 pH. <br> <br>

                            Before Planting broccoli, Land is plowed 3-4 times, then add compost or well rotten FYM 25-30 tons/ hectare and mix thoroughly at the time of land preparation.

                            For creating broccoli plant seedlings, mainly two methods available<br> <br>

                            Soilless media – with the help of coco peat in the plastic nursery tray
                            Soil media – raised soil  bed.<br> <br>  <br>

                           1. prepare  1 meter wide and 3 meters long and 30 cm wide soil bed. <br> <br>
                           2. Mix roughly 10 kgs of good F.Y.M or compost manure into the soil in each bed. Likewise, add 50 grams of foret and 100 gm of Bavistin powder each spring and mix them in soils.<br> <br>
                           3. Then make 5 cm parallel to the 2 cm deep line’s width on the bed and sow broccoli seed. After that, cover the seeds with fine compost material.<br> <br>
                           4. Provide light water with the help of a sprinkler.<br> <br>
                           5. For one hectare, broccoli cultivating hybrid seeds requires approximately 312 grams.<br> <br>
                           6. Seed germination starts after 5 to 6 days, and seedlings and ready for transplantation within 35 days.<br> <br>
                           7. At this time the transplantation, the broccoli plant must have 4-5 leaves.<br> <br>
                           8. The best time sowing of seeds is the second week of September.<br> <br>
                           9. During plant growth, the temperature should be 20° C to 22 ° C.<br> <br>
                           10. for better growth for the seedlings, the ideal night and day temperature is  20° C to 23° C
                            While giving water to the nursery, Give quantity to be calcium nitrate and potassium nitrate, should be given to the plants mixed with 1.5 liters of water in one liter of water.<br> <br>
                           11 Similarly, every 10-12 days of malathion or disease should be prevented due to diseases and diseases that do not affect the plants. + Bavistin 1 gm, or copper oxychloride 1.5 g per liter of water should be sprayed.<br> <br>

                            <strong><i>3.<u>  Fertilizers</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            Before giving fertilizer to the broccoli crop, the soil must be analyzed and then decide fertilizer dose quantity. <br> <br>

                            Generally, the broccoli crop is required to give 150 kg of Nitrogen, 100 kg of phosphorus, and 170kg of potassium per hectare. <br> <br>
                            
                            Nitrogen 120 kg, 80 kg phosphorus, and 60 kg potash should be applied at the transplantation time. The remaining half of nitrogen should be used in two split doses at 30 and 45 days after transplanting. <br> <br>
                            
                            Give micronutrients according to the crop requirement. broccoli plant show born deficiency, so it is observed in the field then apply born with foiler spray or with water fertilizer. <br><br>

                                <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>4.<u> Irrigation </u>:</i></strong><br>
                                Immediately after transplanting, give first irrigation. Depending upon soil, climatic condition, apply irrigation at interval of 7-8 days in summer season and 10-15 days during winter season.  <br> <br>

                                Also, rake the soil on the bed, which helps increase the oxygen level to the root zone.

                               1. Harvest broccoli in the morning, when the buds of the head are firm and tight, just before the heads flower.<br><br>
                               2. If you do see yellow petals, harvest immediately, as the quality will decrease rapidly.<br><br>
                               3. Cut heads from the plant, taking at least 6 inches of stem. Make a slanted cut on the stalk to allow water  to slide away. (Water can pool and rot the center of a flat-cut stalk, runing the secondary heads.)<br><br>
                                4.Most varieties have side-shoots that will continue to develop after the main head is harvested. You can   harvest from one plant for many weeks, in some cases, from spring to fall, if your summer isn’t too hot.<br><br>

                               1. Store broccoli in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. <br> <br>
                               2. If you wash before storing, make sure to dry it thoroughly. <br> <br>
                               3.Broccoli can be blanched and frozen for up to one year. <br> <br>
                             
                            <br><br>

                                <strong><i>8.<u>Seed Production</u>:</i></strong><br>
                                Keep isolation distance of 1600 m from Cole crops and other different varieties of broccoli. Skip one row after every five rows; <br> <br> 
                                 it is essential for field inspection. Remove disease plant; also remove plant showing variation in leaf characteristic. Harvest crop when pods turn brown. Harvesting should be done 2-3 times. After harvesting keep plant in field for curing and drying purpose for a week. After proper drying, for seed purpose, threshing of crop is to be done.
