                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Annually 65 to 95 cm rainfall is required for its cultivation. Excessive rains after sowing, flowering stage and seed maturity stage will result in heavy loss in crop yield.

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"><strong><i>1.<u>Land Preparation</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            Very fine and compact seedbed is not good for chick pea, it required rough seed bed. If it is cultivated as mix crop the land should be plough to fine tilth. If chick pea crop is taken after a kharif fellow carry out one deep ploughing during the monsoon as it will help to conserved rain water. Before sowing plough the land only once. If soil appears to be deficient in moisture run a roller about a week before sowing.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong><i>2.<u>Sowing</u>:</i></strong><br>
                        -->Time of sowing:<br>
                        For rainfed conditions, complete sowing from Oct 10 to Oct 25. Under irrigated condition complete sowing from October 25 to November 10 of desi and kabuli varieties. Sowing on right time is necessary as early sowing leads to excessive vegetative growth, also crop get affected due to wilt while late sowing, crop make poor vegetative growth and inadequate root development.
                        <br><br>
                    -->Spacing:<br>
                        Seed should be spaced 10 cm apart allowing 30-40 cm between rows.
                        <br><br>
                -->Sowing Depth:<br>
                        The seed should be placed 10-12.5 cm deep.
                        <br><br>
            -->Method of sowing:<br>
                        In north India, it is sown by pora method.
                        <br><br>

                       <strong><i>3.<u>Seed</u>:</i></strong><br>
                       Seed Rate:<br>
Use seed rate of 15-18 kg/acre for desi variety and 37 kg/acre for Kabuli variety. Increased seed rate of desi gram to 27 kg/acre in case sowing is to done in second fortnight of November and 36 kg/acre in case sowing is to be done in first fortnight of December.
<br><br>
Seed Treatment:<br>
Mix Trichoderma@2.5 kg/acre + decomposed cow dung@50 kg then cover it with jute bags for 24-72 hrs. Then spray this on moist soil before sowing to control soil borne disease. To prevent seeds from soil borne disease they should be treated with fungicide Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63%WP(Saaf)@2 gm/kg of seed before sowing. In termite affected soil, treat seeds with Chlorpyrifos 20EC@10 ml/kg of seeds before sowing.
Inoculate seed with Mesorhizobium, it will increased productivity of gram and increased yield by 7%. For that first moisten seed with water then apply single packet of Mesorhizobium on seeds. After inoculation dry seeds in shed.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong><i>4.<u>Weeding</u>:</i></strong><br>
                        To keep check on weeds, take first hand weeding or with wheel hoe 25-30days after sowing and second if needed after 60 days of sowing. Simultaneously for effective weed control, pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin @ 1Litre/200Litre water on third day after sowing for one acre land. It will help for controlling annual weeds. In case of less infestation, hand weeding or inter culture with the help of hoe is always better than herbicides because inter culture operations improve aeration in the soil.
                        <br><br>

                       <strong><i>5.<u>Irrigation</u>:</i></strong><br>Where irrigation facilities are available, give a pre-sowing irrigation. It will ensure proper germination and smooth crop growth. After then give second irrigation at time of pre-flowering and one at pod development stage. In case of early rain delay irrigation and give according to requirement. Heavy and excess irrigation enhanced vegetative growth and depresses grain yield. Also it doesn’t tolerate water stagnation in field so provide proper drainage in field.
                       <br><br>

                       <strong><i>6.<u>Harvesting</u>:</i></strong><br>When plant gets dry and leaves turn reddish brown and start shedding, plant is ready to harvest. Cut the plant with sickle. Sundry the harvested crop for five to six days. After proper drying, carry out threshing by beating the plants with sticks or by trampling under the feet of bullocks.               
                       <br><br>

                       <strong><i>7.<u>Post-Harvesting</u>:</i></strong><br>Grains of harvested crop must be well dried before storage. And take care to avoid the pulse beetle infestation in storage.
                       <br><br>
