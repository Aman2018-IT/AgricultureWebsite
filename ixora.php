            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Ixora coccinea (also known as jungle geranium, flame of the woods or jungle flame or pendkuli) is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is a common flowering shrub native to Southern India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.</i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">A warm, moist environment is key for a thriving ixora plant. Temperatures should be kept above 60 degrees Fahrenheit at all times (even in winter); avoid placing your plant anywhere in your home that has a cold draft, like by a nearby window or air conditioner.

                Additionally, ixora plants love humidity. Try keeping your plant in a traditionally humid room of your home, like your kitchen or bathroom. You can also spritz the plant daily with water to increase humidity, or invest in a small space humidifier to put near your ixora plant and any other tropicals you may have.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Well-drained soil and moderate to slightly acidic pH are crucial to growing an Ixora bush. The plant develops chlorosis when installed in alkaline soils.

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">True to their tropical nature, ixora plants love being kept consistently moist. Water them oftenâ€”the specific amount will depend on the specific environment in your home. A good rule of thumb is that the soil should never be allowed to dry out, though you can decrease your watering cadence a bit in the winter.
