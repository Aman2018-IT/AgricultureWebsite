            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Papayas grow in tropical climates and are also known as papaws or pawpaws. Their sweet taste, vibrant color, and the wide variety of health benefits they provide make them a popular fruit. The papaya, a previously exotic and rare fruit, is now available at most times of the year.</i></p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Papaya is a tropical crop, but it does well in a mild tropical climate. It grows well from sea level upto an altitude of 1000m. Papaya should not be grown in areas with strong, hot or dry winds. Dry climate at the time of ripening adds to the sweetness of fruits. Ideal temperature for growing o O papaya is between 25-30 C while temperatures below 10 C delays ripening. In high rainfall areas are not suitable for growing papaya due to the death of the plants by collar- rot disease.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Papaya grows well in well-drained rich sandy loam soils with a depth of 45cm or medium black soils free from water logging. Light soils with pH between 6.5-7 are very good for papaya, if they are adequately manured. </p>

    <div class="Place">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Place of cultivation:</i></strong></h3>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The papaya plant has short life, hence the area under cultivation varies greatly in different years. In India it is cultivated over an area of 97.7 thousand hectares with annual production of 3628.9 thousand MT. In Punjab it is being grown as filler plant in mango and litchi orchards.</p>

    <div class="Pesticides">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Pesticides requirement:</i></strong></h3>           
           <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Papaya plant needs heavy doses of manures and fertilizers. Apart from the basal dose of manures (@ 10 kg./plant) applied in the pits, 200-250 g. each of N, P2O5 and K2O are recommended for getting high yield. Application of 200 g.</i></strong><br> 
           Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate insecticide that has been used since the mid-1960s. Chemically named O,O-Diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloropyridin-2-yl phosphorothioate, chlorpyrifos is also known as Dursban, Lorsban, Whirlwind, Warhawk and Eraser.

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>             
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Papaya needs regular water for its rapid fruit development and yield. During summer months, the plants should be given 20-25 L of water and can be gradually reduced to 10-15 L of water/plant in winter. Drip irrigation helps to save 50-60% water. Irrigation through drip @ 6-8 L/day/plant gives better yields.

                        <strong><u>Propagation in Papaya Farming</u> :-</strong><br> Papaya is invariably propagated by seed. For propagation, seeds are collected from ripe, large sized, healthy fruits, essentially from female plants free from pests and diseases. Sometimes, the seeds fail to germinate because seed viability is completely lost in about 45 days. The removal of a mucilaginous covering (sarcotesta) from the seed is helpful in more rapid and uniform germination than those seeds with their sarcotesta intact. Removal of sarcotesta is easily done by fermenting the seed in a bucket of water for two to three days. The sarcotesta breaks easily when the fermented seeds are mixed with wood ash and are rubbed gently in a piece of gunny cloth. The seeds are washed to remove exogenous material by putting them in another pot or vessel containing water. The viable seeds sink in water, while the nonviable ones, sarcotestas and other debris float and can be skimmed off. The seeds can be sown immediately, or they can be stored after drying in shade in airtight containers. The seeds, however, should never be dried in sun, as this leads to a total loss of their viability.<br><br>
                               
                        <strong><u>Preparing Land for Papaya Farming</u> :-</strong><br> A well-drained upland is selected for cultivation. In open and high lying areas plants are exposed to strong winds or storm. Therefore, for proper establishment of papaya plantation, suitable wind break should be planted at the orchard boundary.<br><br>
                            
                        <strong><u>Planning in papa farming</u>:-</strong><br><br>

                        --><i>Planting Material:-</i> Papaya is commercially propagated by seed and tissue culture plants. The seed rate is 250-300 g./ha. The seedlings can be raised in nursery beds 3m. long, 1m. wide and 10 cm. high as well as in pots or polythene bags. The seeds after being treated with 0.1% Monosan (phenyl mercuric acetate), ceresan etc. are sown 1 cm. deep in rows 10 cm. apart and covered with fine compost or leaf mould. Light irrigation is provided during the morning hours. The nursery beds are covered with polythene sheets or dry paddy straw to protect the seedlings. About 15-20 cm. tall seedlings are chosen for planting in about two months.<br><br>
                            
                        --><i>Best Planting Time for Papaya Farming :-</i> Papaya is planted during spring (February-March), monsoon (June-July) and autumn (October-November).<br><br>
                            
                        --><i>Spacing between Papaya Plants:-</i> A spacing of 1.8 x 1.8 m. is normally followed.  However higher density cultivation with spacing of 1.5 x 1.5 m./ha enhances the returns to the farmer and is recommended.<br><br>
                            
                        --><i>High Density Planting in Papaya Farming :–</i>  A closer spacing of 1.2 x 1.2 m. for cv. Pusha Nanha is adopted for high density planting, accommodating 6,400 plants/ha.<br><br>
                            
                        --><i>Planting Method in Papaya Farming :-</i> The seedlings are planted in pits of 60x60x60 cm. size. In the summer months the pits are dug about a fortnight before planting. The pits are filled with top soil along with 20 kg. of farmyard manure., 1 kg. neem cake and 1 kg. bone meal. Tall and vigorous varieties are planted at greater spacing while medium and dwarf ones at closer spacing.<br><br>
                            
                        <strong><u>Manuring  and Fertilizers in Papaya Farming</u> :-</strong><br> Papaya plant needs heavy doses of manures and fertilizers. Apart from the basal dose of manures (@ 10 kg./plant) applied in the pits, 200-250 g. each of N, P2O5 and K2O are recommended for getting high yield. Application of 200 g. N is optimum for fruit yield but papain yield increases with increase in N upto 300 g.A five month period from transplanting to first flowering is important for nutrition of papaya plants. The stem girth attained by a plant just before flowering decides the vigour and productivity of a plant. If the plant remains weak during this period owing to insufficient nutrition, production during the rest of its life is adversely affected. Therefore, fertilizers should be applied at frequent intervals and at proper rates for building a stout and vigorous plant before flowering, and to maintain its subsequent growth and productivity.<br>
                            
                        In Papaya Farming , the importance of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium for good growth and yield in papaya has been realized. A fertilizer dose of 400g nitrogen, 250g phosphorous and 400g of potassium per plant per year should be applied in six split applications under irrigated conditions, although in rainfed conditions, it can be given in two split doses; the first in the beginning of monsoon and second in the later part. If rainfall is well distributed from March to November, then it can be given in three split doses. Each plant should also be given 20-25 kg of farm yard manure once every year. At the time of fertilization, a sufficient amount of moisture is essential in the soil. The fertilizers should be well mixed in irrigation rings or basins by light digging or hoeing. Application of fertilizers should be stopped 6 months before harvesting the crop. <br><br>
                           
                        <strong><u>Irrigation/Water Supply in Papaya Farming</u> :-</strong><br>  The irrigation schedule is fixed on the basis of soil type and weather conditions of the region. Protective irrigation is provided in the first year of planting. During the second year, irrigation is provided at fortnightly interval in winter and at an interval of 10 days in summer. Basin system of irrigation is mostly followed. In areas having low rainfall, sprinkler or drip system can be adopted.<br><br>
                          
                        <strong><u>Inter-Cropping in Papaya Farming </u>:-</strong><br> The papaya plant grows very quickly and comes to fruit in a year’s time, so intercrops are not usually taken in papaya plantations. Papaya itself is commonly used as an intercrop in tree fruit orchards. Papaya is a shallow-rooted plant, which should never be given deep tillage. Only removal of weeds is required whenever desired. Papaya requires a constant supply of moisture for continuous growth and production, but it is not possible in the hills of this region. However, when there is a danger of frost injury, supply of moisture is useful.<br><br>
                            
                        <strong><u>Insect Pests and Diseases in Papaya Farming </u>:-</strong><br> The insect pests mostly observed are fruit flies (Bactrocera cucurbitae), ak grasshopper (Poekilocerus pictus), aphids (Aphis gossypii), red spider mite (Tetranychus cinnabarinus), stem borer (Dasyses rugosellus) and grey weevil (Myllocerus viridans). In all cases the infected parts need to be destroyed along with application of prophylactic sprays of Dimethoate (0.3%) or methyl demeton (0.05%). <br>
                           
                        The main diseases reported are powdery mildew (Oidium caricae), anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides), damping off and stem rot. Application of wettable sulphur (1 g./l.) carbendazim/thiophanate methyl (1 g./l.) and Kavach/Mancozeb (2 g./l.) has been found to be effective in controlling the diseases.<br><br>
                            
                        <strong><u>Harvesting, Packing, Marketing and Storing</u> :-</strong><br> Fruits are graded on the basis of their weight, size and colour. A good crop may fail if harvesting of fruits is not done properly due to perishable nature of fruits. The fruits should be left on the tree until they mature fully. Usually the fruits are harvested when they are full size, light green with a tinge of yellow at apical end. On ripening, fruits of certain varieties turn yellow but some of them remain green. When the latex ceases to be milky and become watery, the fruits are considered suitable for harvesting.
                        While picking the fruits from the trees, care must be taken that these are not scratched and are free from any blemishes, otherwise there will be attack of fungus and the fruits may start decaying during marketing. Suitable grading must be done before packing. The fruit should be packed properly for dispatching to market.
                            
                        Since papaya fruits are easily perishable, care should be taken to wrap the individual fruit in paper and finally packed in wooden crates surrounded by soft material all-round and saw dust specially on the bottom.
                            
                        In Papaya Farming, reduction in temperature or treatment with retardants reduces the duration for ripening and enhances shelf life. Post harvest treatment of fruits with silver nitrate or cobalt chloride extends the shelf life without affecting the palatability. Papaya fruits, at colour turning, can be stored at 7˚C, which will have normal ripening. Shelf life of fruit is also extended by storing at 13˚C with 1.0 to 1.5 percent oxygen or at 10 % CO. Waxing of fruit and storage under low pressure (LP) has also been successful in reducing the disease incidence and increasing the shelf life papaya.<br><br>
                            
                        <strong><u>Yeild of Papaya Crop</u>:-</strong><br>In Papaya Farming, a tree with good management produces 25 to 40 fruits weighing 40to 60 kg in the first 15 to 18 months.
