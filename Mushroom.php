            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
                In northern India it can be grown from April to September but the most suitable period is from middle of June to middle of September. <br> <br>
                The most suitable temperature for the spread of the mycelium is 24-25°C, while 16-18°C is essential for the formation of fruit bodies. Higher temperature is harmful and low temperature retards the development of both mushroom mycelium and fruit bodies. Paddy straw mushroom can be grown around 35°C.</p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Mushroom cultivation can be done inside in well ventilated room, shed, basement, garage etc. Paddy straw mushroom can be grown outside in shady places.</p>

            Three kinds of mushroom are grown in India. <br> <br>
             
              1. Button Mushroom: <br> <br>
            Popular mushroom grown all over world. Can be grown throughout year. White button mushroom is highly proteinaceous. It is consumed as fresh or canned. It also has medicinal property. Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are major mushroom growing states.
            November to March month is optimum period for growing of button mushroom in UP. For good growth, it requires temperature around 22-25oC, and at reproductive stage it requires temperature around 14-18oC.<br> <br>
             
           2. Straw Mushroom: <Br> <br>
            Straw Mushroom is the third popular mushroom variety grown all over world. They are grown on cotton waste mixed with small amount of straw. These are small mushroom having small cone shape cap. cap is dark brown at top. Its three species are cultivated V. diplasia, V. volvacea and V. esculenta in India. Out of these three species Volvariella volvacea is cultivated in Uttar Pradesh.
            It is also known as “Chinese” or “Paddy” mushroom. These are largely grown in tropical and subtropical regions. It can grow at temperature of 35oC. April to September is optimum period for cultivation of straw mushroom.<br> <br>
            
           3. Oyster Mushroom or Dhingri mushroom: <br> <br>
            Common and edible mushroom. It has tender flesh, velvety texture with mild flavor. It is a rich source of protein, fiber and vitamin B1 to B12. All the varieties or species of oyster mushroom are edible except P. olearius and P. nidiformis which are poisonous. Orissa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and most of the North-Eastern hill states are major states which are producing mushroom.
            October to March is optimum period for growing of oyster mushroom. It survives well in moderate temperature range of 20-30oC with 80-85% relative humidity.

                                       <strong>Spawn/Mushroom seeds preparation</strong> <br>
                                         These are available in markets. One can prepared or produce it on farm. Freshly prepared grain spawn is best for use.  <br> <br>

                                         <strong>Substrate preparation</strong> <br>
                                         Mushroom can be cultivated on a wide range of cellulosic farm waste or other materials like waste paper, cotton waste, cereals straws. Paddy straw or wheat straw is most commonly used material for substrate preparation. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Oyster growing in Polythene bag</strong>  <br> 
                                         Add Carbendazim@7 gm along with Formaline@125 ml in 100 Ltr water and prepare a mixture.
                                         Add 20 kg of wheat straw in above prepared mixture and keep it for 18 hours.
                                         After 18 hours, remove wheat straw and place it on firm or netted surface and remove extra water from it. <br>
                                         Add 2% spawn in wheat straw and fill this mixture in polythene bag of 15 x 12 inch.
                                           Spawned straw is filled about 2/3rd of the capacity of the bag and then tied mouth of polythene bag.
                                           Polythene bag is perforated with 2 mm diam. holes, about 4 cm apart, all over the surface for air circulation purpose.
                                           Then place bags in shelves in the growing room having Relative Humidity of 80-85% and room   temperature of 24-26°C.
                                            Keep these bags in safe places and maintain moisture by sprinkling water on it.
                                            White cottony mycelium is developed on straw. Wheat straw changes its color to brown and become sound and compact.
                                            At this stage cut and remove polythene covering.
                                            In polythene, straw become compacted and become cylinder shape.
                                           Arrange these cylinder shape straws on shelves and maintained moisture by spreading water on it.

                                18-20 days after spawning, first mushroom is appeared. With interval of week, two to three flushes will appears.
                                Carry out harvesting of oyster mushroom, when cap of mushroom starts to fold.
                                For harvesting use sharp knife and it can be harvested by twisting off it with fingers.
                                It is consumed freshly or can be dried in sun or with mechanical dryer. 
                                Within 45-60 days period, from one ton of dry wheat straw more than 500 kg of fresh mushroom can be obtained.

                                  <strong>Pest and their control:</strong>  <br> <br>

                                   Nematodes: The nematodes eat the spawn. <br> <br>
    
                                  Treatment: It can be controlled through pasteurization. At the time of compost for the prevention Furadan @120 gm (per 300 gm) should be added.
