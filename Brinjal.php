            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left; margin-left: 32px;"><i>Brinjal is one of the most common tropical vegetables grown in India. It is known by different names like Begun (Bengali), ringna (Gujarathi), baingan ( Hindi), badane (Kannada), waangum (Kashmiri), vange ( Marathi), baigan (Oriya), Vashuthana ( Malayalam), Kathiri (Tamil), venkaya (Telugu) and Peethabhala (Sanskrit). A large number of cultivars differing in size, shape and colour of fruits are grown in India. Immature fruits are used in curries and a variety of dishes are prepared out of brinjal. Fruits are moderate sources of vitamins and minerals like phosphorous, calcium and iron and nutritive value varies from variety to variety. </i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">It can be grown in plains throughout the year but rabi season is the best.

               <br> Rainy Season - June – July
               <br> Winter Season - October – November
               <br> Summer Season - February – March
              <br><br>
            
               Brinjal is a warm season crop and requires a long warm growing season. It is very susceptible to frost. A daily mean temperature of 13-21 oC is most favourable for its successful production. The growth of the crop is severely affected when temperature falls below 17 oC. It can be successfully grown as a rainy season and summer season crop and can be grown at an elevation of 1200m above the sea level.</p>

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Brinjal is a hardy crop and is cultivated under a wide range of soils. Since a long duration crop with high yield, well -drained and fertile soil is preferred for the crop. Crops grown in sandy soils yield early and those grown in clayey soils yield more. Ideal pH for cultivation of crop is 5.5 - 6.6.

                   <strong>Pest and their control</strong>  
                   <strong> Fruit and Shoot Borer:</strong> It is one of the major and serious insect pests of brinjal. A short pinkish caterpillar bores into the terminal shoot and eats internal tissue in initial stages, later it bores into the young fruit. The large holes can be seen on the infected fruits. The insect affected fruits become unfit for consumption.

                    Scout field every week after transplanting for fruit and shoot borer infestation. Remove and destroyed infected fruits. Take spray of Triazophos@20ml/10Ltr water and Neem extract@50gm/Ltr, one month after transplanting. Repeat spray with interval of 10-15 days. When crop is in flowering stage take spray of Chlorantraniliprole 18.5%SC (Coragen)@5ml+Teepol@5ml in 12 Ltr of water, twice with 20 days interval.
                    
                    In initial stage of infestation, take spray of 5% Neem extract@50gm/Ltr. If infestation is seen in field take sprayed of 25% Cypermethrin@2.4 ml/10Ltr of water on affected crops. For high population spray Spinosad@1ml/Ltr of water. Avoid spraying of Triazophos or any other insecticide after fruit maturation and harvest.  </p>
                    
     :<br>
     <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">1.<u>Aphids </u>:-</i></strong><br>
               The plants are also attacked by mite, aphids and mealy bug. They suck the sap from the leaves resulting in yellowing and drooping of leaves.

              If infestation of Aphid, white fly is observed in field to control take spray of Deltamethrin + Triazophos combination@ 10ml/10Ltr of water. To keep check on white fly spray with Acetamiprid@5gm/15Ltr of water.
            </p>
                    <br><br>
                <strong style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"><i>2.<u>Thrips:</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">To check severity of thrips, keep blue sticky traps@6-8 per acre and to reduce the incidence take spray of Verticillium lecani@5gm/Ltr of water. If incidence of thrips is more, to control take spray of Fipronil@2ml/Ltr of water.</p>

                
                <strong style="color: white;font-size: 20px;" ><i>3.<u>Mite:</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"> If infestation of Mite is observed in field, to control take spray of Abamectin@1-2ml/Ltr or Fenazaquin@2ml/Ltr of water.</p>


                <strong style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"><i>4.<u>Leaf eating caterpillar:</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
       
                <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;" > Some time Incidence of caterpillars is seen mostly at initial stage of crop.

                    To control spray with neem based pesticides. If those are not that effective and infestation become high then only take spray of chemicals pesticides like Emamectin benzoate@4gm or Lambda Cyhalothrin@2ml/1Ltr of water.</p>

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>1.<u>Land preparation and sowing</u>:</i></strong><br>
                        Before transplanting the soil should be well prepared by deep ploughing 4-5 times and levelled. When the field is well prepared and levelled, the beds of suitable size are made in the field before transplanting.
                          
                        <br> <br>
                       <strong> Time of Sowing : </strong> 
                       For first crop, prepare nursery in October and seedlings are ready for transplantation in November.
                       Second crop, prepare nursery in November and transplantation in first fortnight of February.
                       Third crop, sow nursery in February-March and transplantation before end of April.
                       Fourth crop, sow nursery in July and transplantation in August.
                       <br>
                      <strong> Spacing :</strong>
                       The spacing generally depends on the variety (size and spread and bearing period) soil fertility. Use row to row spacing of 60 cm and plant to plant spacing of 35-40 cm.
                       <br>
                       <strong> Sowing Depth :</strong>
                       In nursery sow seeds at depth of 1 cm and then covered with soil.  
                       <br>
                      <strong> Method of Sowing : </strong>
                       Transplantation of seedling in main field.

                       <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>2.<u>Irrigation</u>:</i></strong><br>
                          
                            Irrigate the field after every third or fourth day during the summer season and after 12 to 15 days during the winter season. Timely irrigation is very important for high yields of brinjal. Brinjal fields should be regularly irrigated to keep the soil moist during frosty days. Avoid water stagnation in field as brinjal cannot tolerate water logging.
                                 <br><br>

                            <strong><i>3.<u> Weed control</u>:</i></strong><br>

                            Generally two - four weeding’s and hoeing are necessary for weed control, aeration and for the good growth of plants. Mulching with black polythene film reduces weed growth and maintains soil temperature.
                            
                            To control weeds efficiently, do pre-plant soil application of Fluchloralin@800-1000 ml/acre or Oxadiazon@400g/acre and pre-plant surface spraying of Alachlor@2 ltr/acre for better results.

                                     <strong><i>4.<u>Harvesting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                                     The fruits become ready for first picking in about 120-130 days of seed sowing depending on the variety. The harvesting of the fruits should be done as soon as it attains a good size and colour. Fruits are harvested when they become greenish yellow or bronze and their flesh turns dry and tough. Pressing the thumb against the side of the fruit can indicate the maturity of the fruit. If the pressed portion springs back to its original shape, the fruit is too immature. Some portion of the calyx and the stem-end is retained on the fruit during harvesting. Since all the fruits do not mature at the same time, the fruits are harvested at an interval of 8-10 days.
                                     <br>

                                <strong><i>5.Post Harvest<u></u>:</i></strong><br>

                                Brinjal fruits cannot be stored at room temperature for long duration because of high transpiration rate and water loss. Brinjal fruit can be stored for 2-3 weeks at 10-11°C temperature and 92% relative humidity. After harvesting, Grading is done on the basis of Super, Fancy and Commercial. For packing, use gunny bags or baskets.

                                 <strong><i>6.<u>Pest and Diseases</u>:</i></strong> <br>
                                 Brinjal is attacked by a number of insect pests and nematodes during various stages of crop growth in most of the tropical countries including India. The extent of losses caused by these pests depends on

                                 season, variety, soil and other factors (Dhamdhare et al., 1995; Roy and Pande, 1995). Some of the important ones are briefly described below
