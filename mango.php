            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. </i></p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Mango is very well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives well in almost all the regions
                0 0 of the country from sea level to an altitude of 600 m. The ideal temperature range for mango is 24 -30 C
                during the growing season, along with high humidity. A rainfall range of 890-1,015 mm in a year is
                considered as ideal for growing mangoes. However, mango can be grown in regions of both heavy
                (2540 mm) or scanty (254 mm) rainfall. Dry weather before blossoming is conducive to profuse
                flowering. Rain during flowering is detrimental to the crop as it interferes with pollination. </p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Fog, cloudy weather at the time of flowering from November to February results in poor setting of fruits
                and favours pest and disease incidence. Mango grows well on wide variety of soils, such as lateritic,
                alluvial, sandy loam and sandy.The loamy, alluvial, well-drained, aerated and deep soils (2-2.5 m) rich
                in organic matter with a pH range of 5.5-7.5 are ideal for mango cultivation. The water table should be
                around 3 m and soils with high water table are unsuitable for mango. </p>

    <div class="Place">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Place of cultivation:</i></strong></h3>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Mango is commercially cultivated in Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttara Khand, Punjab and Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Mango cultivated over an area of 2309 thousand hectares with an annual production of 12750 thousand metric tones. India produces quality mangoes; Alphonso is highly liked by the western countries.
               <br>
                In Punjab, mango is being cultivated in whole of the sub­-moutane belt comprising Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur Roop Nagar, Fatehgarh Sahib, Mohali and Patiala districts. Now its cultivation has spread to arid canal irrigated areas of northern India.</p>

    <div class="Pesticides">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Pesticides requirement:</i></strong></h3>
            
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Many pests affect the mango crop. To control these pests, a number of pesticides are used. Use of pesticides may lead to their deposit in or on the crop after harvest or during storage. Pesticide residues also include any breakdown products of the pesticide.

                        For every pesticide on mango, Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) are fixed. MRLs are the levels of pesticides that can be ingested daily by man without appreciable risk. MRLs are expressed in terms of mg/kg or ppm. To achieve these levels, a time gap needs to be maintained between the last spray and the first harvest. This time gap is known as the Pre Harvest Interval (PHI) or waiting period. Post Harvest Interval of pesticides is also calculated on a crop where treatment is imposed after harvesting the crop.
                        
                        In the Pesticide Residue Laboratory at IIHR, supervised field trials of various pesticides used on mango for control of pests and diseases have been undertaken. Results of the persistence study and prescribed MRL values are taken into account to work out the Pre Harvest Interval (PHI) for every individual pesticide on mango. It is necessary to follow this recommendation to limit the residues within the permissible level

                       <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Simple process to reduce pesticide residue deposit on mango</strong><br>
                       --> Major portion of the non-systemic pesticide sprayed on mango remains on the fruit skin. Even systemic pesticide residues that are absorbed by the plant can result in more residue deposit on the fruit surface. Therefore, some simple processes can be followed to reduce deposit on mango fruits:
                        <br>
                        ·         Washing with water
                        <br>
                        ·         Washing with dilute solution of common salt
                        <br>
                        ·         Washing with dilute soap solution
                        <br>
                        ·         Peeling off the fruit skin.
                       <br><br> 
                    --> Guideliness to minimize pesticide residues on mango
                        <br>
                        ·         Always use approved pesticide at recommended doses
                        <br>
                        ·    Apply chemical pesticides at the vegetative growth stage and botanicals in fruit bearing stages
                        <br>
                        ·         Do not spray the crop when it is ready for harvest
                        <br>
                        ·         Use eco-friendly pesticide effective at lower doses
                        <br>
                        ·         Adopt IPM package of practices
                        <br>
                        ·         Use protective gear while spraying pesticides</p></div>

           6.<u><strong>Dasheri</u> :</strong>
           This is the popular “chusne wala aam”. The homeland of this mango is Uttar Pradesh. It is the oldest variety of mango, and were first grown by the Nawabs of India.<br><br>
           
           7.<u><strong>TotaPuri</u>:</strong>
            The Totapuri mango is the easiest type of mango to identify due to its parrot beak-like shape at the tip, hence symbolizing its name. It is from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu i.e Southern part of India.<br><br>

            9.<u><strong>Himsagar</u> :</strong>
            Amongst all the varieties of mangoes, this variety has the shortest season span of them all. Himsagar originates in Northeast regions of India such as West Bengal.<br><br>
            
            10.<u><strong>Langra</u> :</strong>
            This variety of mango was first grown by a farmer in Varanasi (Benaras) who was unfortunately disabled (limp) hence the name Langra came into being. It is very popular in West Bengal, Haryana, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

                <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">
                        
                        <strong><u>Planting</u> :</strong><br> should be prepared by deep ploughing followed by harrowing and levelling with
                        a gentle slope for good drainage. Spacing varies from 10 m x 10 m, in the dry zones where growth is less, to 12 m x 12 m, in heavy rainfall areas and rich soils where abundant vegetative growth occurs. New dwarf hybrids like Amrapali can be planted at closer spacing. Pits are filled with original soil mixed with 20-25 kg well rotten FYM, 2.5 kg single super phosphate and 1 kg muriate of potash.<br>

                        One year old healthy, straight growing grafts from reliable sources can be planted at the centre of pits along with the ball of the earth intact during rainy season in such a way that the roots are not expanded and the graft union is above the ground level. Plants should be irrigated immediately after planting. In the initial one or two years, it is advisable to provide some shade to the young plants and also stake to make them grow straight.<br><br>

                        <strong><u>Training and pruning</u>:</strong><br>
                        About one meter from the base on the main trunk should be kept free from branching and the main stem can be allowed thereafter spaced at 20-25 cm apart in such a way that they grow in different directions. Branches which cross over/rub each other may be removed at pencil thickness.<br><br>

                       <strong><u>Fertiliser Application</u>:</strong><br>
                        In general, 170 gm urea, 110 gm single super phosphate and 115 gm muriate of potash per plant per year of the age from first to tenth year and thereafter 1.7 kg, 1.1 kg, and 1.15 kg respectively of these fertilisers per plant per year can be applied in two equal split doses (June-July and October). Foliar spray of 3% urea is recommended before flowering in sandy areas.<br><br>

                       <strong><u>Irrigation</u>:</strong><br>
                        Young plants are watered frequently for proper estalbishment. In case of grown up trees, irrigation at 10 to 15 days interval from fruit set to maturity is beneficial for improving yield.However, irrigation is not recommended for 2-3 months prior to flowering as it is likely to promote vegetative growth at the expense of flowering.<br><br>

                       <strong><u>Inter cropping</u>:</strong><br>
                       Inter crops such as vegetables, legumes, short duration and dwarf fruit crops like papaya, guava,peach, plum, etc. depending on the agro-climatic factors of the region can be grown. The water and nutrient requirements of the inter crops must be met separately.<br><br>

                       <strong><u>Plant Protection</u>:</strong><br>
                       Mango is prone to damages by a large number of pests, diseases and disorders.<br> 
                       The recommended control measures for most important and common among them are briefed below :<br><br>
                       
                       <strong>Mango hopper :</strong> Two sprays (at panicles emergency and at pea size of fruits) of carbaryl (0.15%), monocrotophos (0.04%) or phosphamidan (0.05).<br>
                       
                       <strong>Mealy bug :</strong> Ploughing inter spaces in November and dusting 2% methyl parathion @200 g per tree near the trunk and fixing 20 cm wide 400 gauge polythene strips around the trunk with grease applied on the lower edge in January as prophylactic measures and two sprays of monocrotophos (0.04%) at 15 days interval as control are needed.<br>
                       
                       <strong>Powdery mildew :</strong> Two to three sprays of wettable sulphur (0.2%) or Kerathane (0.1%) at 10-15 days interval.<br>
                       
                       <strong>Anthracrose :</strong> Two sprays of Baristin (0.1%) at fortnight interval.<br>

                       <strong>Malformation :</strong> One spray of 200 ppm NAA in October followed by deblossoming at bud burst stage in December - January.<br>

                       <strong>Fruit drop :</strong> Regular irrigation during fruit development, timely and effective control of pests and diseases and spraying 20 ppm NAA at pea size of fruits.<br><br>

                       <strong><u>Harvesting and yield </u>:</strong><br>
                       Graft plants start bearing at the age of 3 - 4 years (10-20 fruits) to give optimum crop from 10- 15th year which continues to increase upto the age of 40 years under good management.<br><br>

                       <strong><u>Post Harvest Management </u>:</strong><br>
                       Storage : Shelf life of mangoes being short (2 to 3 weeks) they are cooled as soon as possible to storage temperatue of 13 degree Celcius. A few varieties can withstand storage temperature of 10 degree Celcius. Steps involved in post harvest handling include preparation, grading, washing,drying, waxing, packing, pre-cooling, palletisation and transportation.
