            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>It is a durable flowering potted plant requiring very little maintenance in the home or office. It has dark green, thick waxy leaves with scalloped-edges and small, four-petaled flowers in clusters held above the foliage. It is also available in a double flowering variety with as many as 26 petals per bloom</i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Because kalanchoes are native to tropical and subtropical climates, they require an outdoor temperature of around 45 degrees Fahrenheit or higher to survive. Kalanchoe plants grow and bloom best in temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. The plants are sensitive to cold and need frost protection.</p>

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">It's essential to get well-drained soil for your cutting so that the soil doesn't trap too much moisture. You can find well-drained soil at gardening stores, and can even find soil that is formulated especially for succulents. You can also try a mix of 60% peat moss and 40% perlite.

                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Kalanchoes are succulents, which means they store water in their leaves and don’t need soil to be constantly moist. In fact, waterlogged soils will cause the stem of your new kalanchoe to rot —and you don’t want that! The best rule of thumb for watering a kalanchoe is to stick your finger in the soil every few days. When the top 2 inches of soil is dry (all the way dry, not just sort of dry), it’s time to water. Indoors, this will probably mean you’ll only need to water every 2 or 3 weeks, but be sure to check regularly. Outdoors during the summer, take care to move your kalanchoe undercover if the forecast is calling for several inches of rain. It’s worth knowing, too, that during the winter it will grow more slowly, leading to even more time between waterings.
