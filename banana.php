          <h1 style=" font-size: 60px; text-align: center; color:white;"><i>BANANA</i></h1>
    

    
            <p style="color:white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Banana (Musa sp.) is the second most important fruit crop in India next to mango. Its year round availability, affordability, varietal range, taste, nutritive and medicinal value makes it the favourite fruit among all classes of people. It has also good export potential.</i></p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Banana is essentially tropical plant requiring a warm and humid climate. However, it can be grown
                from sea level to all altitudes of 1200 metres. It can be cultivated in a temperature range of 10°C
                and 40°C with high humidity but growth is retarded at temperatures of 20°C and less and more 0
                than 35°C. Yields are higher when temperatures are above 24 C for a considerable period. In
                cooler climate, the crop requires longer time to mature. Plants exposed to low temperature and
                humidity during active growth stage show reduced growth and yields. Hot winds blowing in high
                speed during the summer month's shred and desiccate the leaves. It requires on an average, 1700
                mm rainfall distributed throughout the year for its satisfactory growth.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Deep, rich loamy soil with pH between 6.5 – 7.5 is most preferred for banana cultivation. Soil for banana should have good drainage, adequate fertility and moisture. Saline solid, calcareous soils are not suitable for banana cultivation. A soil which is neither too acidic nor too alkaline, rich in organic material with high nitrogen content, adequate phosphorus level and plenty of potash is good for banana.</p>

    <div class="Place">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Place of cultivation:</i></strong></h3>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">With total annual production of 16.91 million tones from 490.70 thousand ha., with national average of 33.5 T/ha. Maharashtra ranks first in production with 60 T/ha. Banana contributes 37% to total fruit production in India. Banana occupy 20% area among the total area under crop in India. Maharashtra ranks second in area and first in productivity in India. Jalgaon is a major Banana growing district in Maharashtra which occupy 50,000 hectares area under Banana. </p>

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Pesticides requirement:</i></strong></h3>
            
                    <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">1.<u>Chlorpyrifos</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                    Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate insecticide that has been used since the mid-1960s. Chemically named O,O-Diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloropyridin-2-yl phosphorothioate, chlorpyrifos is also known as Dursban, Lorsban, Whirlwind, Warhawk and Eraser.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><i>2.<u>Azoxystrobin</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                    Azoxystrobin is also a fungicide, used for a variety of produce farming. Known by commercial names including Amistar and Heritage, azoxystrobin is effective against multiple fungi such as powdery mildew, late blight, apple scab and rusts. Absorbed through the banana tree's roots it moves through the leaves to keep fungus at bay. Referred to as Methyl (E)-2-{2-[6-(2-cyanophenoxy) pyrimidin-4-yloxy]phenyl}-3-methoxyacrylate), azoxystrobin has a low toxicity to most avian, aquatic and terrestrial animals.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><i>3.<u>Thiabendazole</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                    ​Thiabendazole, also known as the medications Mintezol and Tresaderm, is a fungicide and parasiticide that is used on banana planatations. Its chemical formula is C10H7N3S. Thiabendazole is the most common pesticide residue found in bananas, occuring in 48.1 percent of the bananas tested, according to the Pesticide Action Network North America. Although banana farmers use particularly high amounts of pesticides, with the Environmental Working Group putting the number at 35 pounds per acre, the residues aside from thiabendazole are particularly low because the banana peel protects the edible portion from many chemicals.
                    <br><br><strong><i>4.<u>Imidacloprid</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                    Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid, which acts as a neurotoxic insecticide. This chemical compound, 1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-N-nitroimidazolidin-2-ylideneamine, can be used as a seed treatment or applied topically, and is effective against soil, chewing and sucking insects, according to the National Pesticide Information Center, a joint body between the EPA and Oregon State University.

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">->Banana, a water loving plant, requires a large quantity of water for maximum productivity. But Banana roots are poor withdrawal of water. Therefore under Indian condition banana production should be supported by an efficient irrigation system like drip irrigation. 
                      <br>
                     ->Water requirement of banana has been worked out to be 2000mm per Annum. Application of drip irrigation and mulching technology has reported improved water use efficiency. There is saving of 56% of water and increasing yield by 23-32% under drip.
                     <br>  
                    -> Irrigate the plants immediately after planting. Apply sufficient water and maintain field capacity. Excess irrigation will lead to root zone congestion due to removal of air from soil pores, thereby affecting plant establishment and growth.

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;">
                            <strong><i>1.<u>Planting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            Planting of banana is done by two methods viz. Pit method and furrow method. Planting is done from February to May whereas in North India, it is done during July-August. In South-India, it can be done any time of year except summer. Tall varieties should be planted at 3x3 m whereas dwarf ones at 2x2 m apart.
                       <br><br>
                       <strong><i>2.<u>Manuaring</u>:</i></strong><br>
                       Banana is a heavy feeder and responds well to manuring. Banana is a quick growing and short-lived plant. Therefore, it is more beneficial, if quick growing fertilizers are applied. In Tamil Nadu, application of 100 g of N, 30 g of P2O5 and 300 g of K2O per plant to be supplied in three doses during the second, third and fifth months is recommended. In Maharashtra, 100 g N, 40 g P2O5 and 100 g K2O per plant is recommended. Out of these, P2O5 and K2O is applied at the time of planting and N is given is three split doses: third, fourth and fifth month after planting.

                  <strong><i>3.<u>After Cares</u>:</i></strong><br>
                  <i>1. Desuckering</i>:
                 Desuckering is an important operation in banana cultivation. In this, the unwanted suckers, which develop near the base of the plant, are removed. Cutting the suckers from ground level and then pouring the kerosene (2-3 drops) to kill the growing point of pseudostem does it.
                  <i>2. Propping</i>:
                  It is an essential cultural practice to give proper support to the plants with bamboos. It is done to avoid falling down of plants due to high winds.

                 <i>3. Wrapping</i>:
                 to protect the fruits from sunburn, hot wind and dust the bunch is covered. Wrapping is also done to improve the colour of the fruit.
                 <br><br>
                 <strong><i>4.<u>Plant-Protection</u>:</i></strong><br>
                 <i><strong> >>Disease</strong> </i>:
                 Important diseases of banana are:
                <br> <i>1. Panama wilt</i>:
                 It is caused by the soil bourne fungi Fusarium oxysporum.
                 <br>Symptoms: Leaves become yellow, Pseudostem splits and breaks.
                 <br>Control Measures: Eradication of the infected plants. Growing resistant varieties like Dwarf Cavendish. Soil drenching with Vapam @ 0.85% and mercuric chloride @ 3000 PPM in nursery.
                  <br><br>
                <i>2. Bunchy Top</i>:
                It is caused by the virus, which is transmitted by an aphid Pentalonia nigroneruosa. 
               <br><u> Symptoms</u>: Infected plants have short, narrow, erect leaves with short petiole. Plants remain slanted.
           <br>  <u>Control Measures</u>: Infected plants should be uprooted and burnt. Spraying of 2-4, D to control weeds.
               
             <br><br><i><strong> >>Insect-Pests</strong> </i>:
             <br><u>Root stock weevil</u>:- Damaging stage is adult and grub
             <br><u>Symptoms of damage</u>:- Grub bores into stem which is affected by fungi or bacteria.
           <br> <u>Control measures</u>:- Use healthy suckers and rhizomes. Before planting treat the pit with 0.65 %. Lindane 60-80 g/pit. Soak the sucker in 0.1% Lindane solution, spray 0.05 % endosulfan.
