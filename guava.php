            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Guavas are tropical trees originating in Central America.

                Their fruits are oval in shape with light green or yellow skin and contain edible seeds. Whatâ€™s more, guava leaves are used as an herbal tea and the leaf extract as a supplement.
                
                Guava fruits are amazingly rich in antioxidants, vitamin C, potassium, and fiber.</i></p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Guava is successfully grown under tropical and subtropical climate. The quality of the fruits is better in
                areas having distinct winters therefore guava grown near Allahabad is famous for the best quality
                fruits. Although guava tolerates drought, protective irrigation facilities are required. It grows best with
                an annual rainfall around 1000 mm restricted between June and September. </p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The importance of guava is due to the fact that it is a hardy plant, which can be grown on wide
                varieties of soils including shallow, medium black and alkaline soil. However, it grows successfully
                on well-drained soils with atleast 0.5 to 1m in depth. The soils should not be very deep, marshy,
                low lying, having hard pan or water table in the root zones. The pH should be between 5.5 to 7.5. </p>

    <div class="Place">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Place of cultivation:</i></strong></h3>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">In India, the guava is grown in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.</p>

    <div class="Pesticides">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Pesticides requirement:</i></strong></h3>
            
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">As you  know, there are plenty of pests that are attracted to guava trees. The best way to combat insect attackers is to keep the tree healthy. Provide optimal growing conditions with irrigation when needed, adequate drainage and fertilization, and prune out any dead or diseased limbs. Keep the area around the tree free from plant detritus and weeds that can harbor insects. Keep a close eye on the tree for any signs of pest damage so that appropriate guava pest control can be applied at the first sign of infestation.

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"> Actual evapotranspiration for guava was estimated by using Penman Monteith method (FAO 56). Yearly average water requirement of guava was estimated to be 206 mm after subtracting the effective rainfall. Irrigation was supplied to each plant using two emitters (online) of 4 L h-1 capacity. The analysis of data revealed 164 per cent greater yield in case of drip (VD) as compared to that of ring basin irrigation (VRB). The plastic mulch had significant influence on crop yield with all the levels of drip and ring basin methods of irrigations. The treatment VDM showed highest (47.2 t ha-1) yield followed by VD alone (37.7 t ha-1). The lowest yield (14.9 t ha-1) was observed in ring basin (VRB) irrigation method. Total annual income, benefit-cost ratio, net profit mm-1 of water used and water use efficiency was estimated and all these economic analysis parameters found to be highest for the treatment VDM. Total annual income from one hectare was found to be highest (INR 2,00,400) in case of treatment VDM followed by the treatment VD (INR 1, 52,700) and lowest for the treatment VRB (INR 57900). Treatment VDM resulted highest benefit-cost ratio (4.7) followed by the treatment VD (6.73) and least in the treatment VRB (2.16). The net profit from mm-1 of water used was found highest for the treatment VDM (INR 800.7) followed by the treatment 0.6 VDM (INR 617.2) and minimum in VRB (INR 164.5).

                            <strong><u>Guava Planting</u>:</strong>
                            The guava planting should be done in pits of 1m x 1m x 1m size filled with mixture of FYM and soil during rainy season (July-August) or in spring (February-March) at a distance of 6 m x 6 m.<br><br>

                             <strong><u>Propagation and Rootstock of Guava</u>:</strong><br><br>
                            --> Guava plants grown directly from seed give poor fruit yield and quality, and come into bearing late. Seeds should be used for rootstock raising. Subsequently, inarching or budding (patch or shield) can be done for propagation.<br>

                            --> In recent times, stooling has been found cheapest and easiest method of propagation. As seeds loose viability after extraction, they should be sown immediately.<br>

                            --> Soaking of seeds in water for 12 hours gives about 90 per cent germination. Time of guava propagation is Feb-March and July-August. Guava can also be successfully propagated by air layering.<br><br>

                            <strong><u> Training and Pruning</u>:</strong>
                            The plant should be trained to a low-headed system of open centre or delayed open centre keeping scaffold limbs having wide crotch angles. Pruning is not generally required every year, however, terminal shoots may be headed back to stop overcrowding of trees.<br><br>
                            
                             <strong><u>Manuring and Fertilization</u></strong>:
                            Although guava is grown without application of any manure and fertilizer, it responds well in their application by giving higher yield and better quality fruit.

                            <strong><u>Irrigation Guidance for Guava Cultivation</u>:</strong><br>
                            Guava is mostly grown under rainfed conditions and irrigation is generally not practiced but wherever the irrigation is available, it should be given in summer and October/Novermber as it enhances the yield of guava tree by increasing fruit set.<br><br>

                            <strong><u>Intercropping of Guava</u>:</strong><br>
                            Guava orchards may be intercropped with short growing leguminous crops like mash, moong, guar and vegetables during pre-bearing period.<br><br>

                            <strong><u>Aftercare of Guava</u>:</strong><br>
                            -->Pre-harvest spray of calcium nitrate (2%) two weeks before harvest improve quality at the time of harvest of guava, whereas, the spray of 150 ppm silver nitrate at 5 weeks before harvest and another spray at three weeks after first spray increases the shelf life of guava satisfactorily upto 6 days at room temperature.<br>
                            
                            -->GA, 90 ppm, sprayed 30 days before harvest improves the fruit quality at harvest and also increases the shelf life of guava.<br><br>

                            <strong><u>Guava Harvesting and Yield</u>:</strong><br>
                            -->In guava cultivation, grafted plants come into bearing at the age of 3 years and peak harvesting periods are August-September for rainy season crop and Jan-Feb. for winter season crop.<br>

                            -->Guava develops best flavour and aroma only when they ripe on tree. A ten year old guava tree gives a yield, up to 100 kg of fruit.<br><br>

                            <strong><u>Crop regulation</u>:</strong><br>
                             -->The guava fruits produced in the rainy season are not of high quality and have poor shelf life. Spray 10 per cent urea or 600 ppm NAA during April-May when maximum flowers have opened.<br>

                            -->This eliminates rainy season crop so that winter guava crop is heavy and of superior quality. One leaf pair pruning of guava plants in the first week of may offers an effective method for avoiding rainy season crop, resulting into more yield and better quality in winter season crop.
