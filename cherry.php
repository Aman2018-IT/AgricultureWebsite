          <h1 style=" font-size: 60px; text-align: center; color: white;"><i>CHERRY</i></h1>
    

    
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit).

                Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, such as the sweet Prunus avium and the sour Prunus cerasus. The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in "ornamental cherry" or "cherry blossom".</i></p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">As we all know Cherry grows well in cold climatic conditions, it requires about 1200hr to 1500hr  chilling period during winter seaso and requires an annual rainfall of 100cm to 125cm.
            Cherry fruits are grown at the height of 2500 meteres above sea level.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The cherry tree requires the deep sandy loam soil with the pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. A well drained fertile soil with moisture holding capacity is best for cherry cultivation.
            As the cherry trees are sensitive to water stagnation,make sure to have internal well drainage in  the soil,and avoid heavy soils in cherry fruit cultivation.

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">In India, cherry commercial cultivation is carried in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh due to suitable climate. </p>

                    <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">1.<u>Dormant-Sprays</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                        Dormant sprays are the most important pesticide applications for cherry trees. These sprays help reduce the number of overwintering insects and pathogens that can damage the trees and reduce yield during the upcoming season. Early dormant sprays are applied in the fall when all of the leaves are gone. Lime-sulfur and dormant oils are applied for control of powdery mildew and overwintering insects. If bacterial canker (gummosis) is a problem, fixed copper sprays are applied. Chlorothalonil fungicide is sometimes used when Coryneum blight (shot-hole) is a problem, but copper sprays are also effective.

                        Delayed dormant sprays are applied when the buds begin to show green tissue. Horticultural oils are applied alone or with lime-sulfur for the control of insects and powdery mildew. When applying these dormant oils, it is important to make sure that the trees are thoroughly covered because the oils work by suffocating the attached insects.

                    <strong><i>2.<u>Pesticides sprayed at petal fall or shuck stage</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                    Pesticide applications at petal fall can help prevent problems with insects, mites, shot hole disease and powdery mildew. Insecticidal soaps are soft pesticides for controlling mites and aphids. Biological pesticides made with Bacillus thuringenesis (for caterpillars) and Beauveria (mites and aphids) are also available.

                    Malathion is an organophosphate pesticide that can also be used for aphid control. Powdery mildew control requires a lime-sulfur spray and shot hole disease can be controlled by a wettable sulfur.

                    <strong><i>3.<u>Late Spring Control of Fruit Fly and Mites
                    </u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                    Pesticide sprays are not needed to control fruit fly infestations, instead use fruit fly bait. This bait attracts and kills fruit flies for several meters around where it is placed. If it is not available in your area, Malathion can be used. If there is a problem with both fruit flies and mites, use a biological product whose common name is Spinosad, but apply it in the evening to avoid harming bees. </p>

                        >>For all of the fruit these trees produce, they don’t require much in the way of fertilizers and water. <br>
                       >>About an inch of rain per week is ample.Use a rain gauge that sacrifices style in exchange for an easy-to-read and practical setup.<br>
                       >>If you’re in a dry spell and aren’t reaching that rain requirement, you can water once a week. However, don’t over saturate the roots and soil; dry roots are healthier than waterlogged ones. A good soaking once a week during periods of dry weather is plenty.

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>1.<u>Planting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            1.Plant cherries in the late fall or early spring (when the ground is soft and has a higher moisture content).<br>
                            2.For sweet cherries, make sure the different varieties will pollinate each other.<br>
                            3.Plant in a sunny site with good air circulation; avoid planting near trees or buildings that shade.
                            <br>
                            4.Cherry trees need deep, well-drained soil. 
                            <br>
                            5.Space sweet cherries 35 to 40 feet apart; dwarfs, 5 to 10 feet apart.
                            <br>
                            6.Space tart cherries 20 to 25 feet apart; dwarfs, 8 to 10 feet apart.
                            <br>
                            7.Set trees on standard rootstocks with the graft union a few inches below the soil level. Set trees on dwarf rootstock with the graft union several inches above the soil level.
                            <br>
                            8.When planting fan-trained trees, construct the necessary supports before planting. Plant fans only 12 to 15 feet apart.
                            <br>
                            9.For bareroot trees, place the rootstock on a small mound of soil in the center of the planting hole, and spread the roots down and away, trying not to bend the roots. Backfiill with soil.
                            <br>
                            10.For container-grown trees, first remove the rootball and on its side; cut through the roots with shears. Don’t cover the top of the root-ball.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong><i>2.<u>Care</u>:</i></strong><br>
                        >>There is no difference in care between sour and sweet cherries.<br>
                        >>Apply mulch to retain moisture.<br>
                        >>Drape netting over trees to protect the fruit from birds.<br>
                        >>Water routinely in dry areas.<br>
                        >>Thinning the fruit is not necessary for cherry trees, as they typically thin naturally in early summer.<br>
                        >>Prune trees every year in late winter to encourage the growth of new fruiting wood. Don’t prune in the fall.<br>
                        >>Fertilize each spring until trees start to bear, then fertilize only after harvest each season.

                       <br><br><strong><i>4.<u>Harvest</u>:</i></strong><br>
                       >> Pick fruits only when FULLY ripe (dark red, black, yellow); the sugar content rises the few days before fully ripened.<br>
                       >> Be ready to harvest within a week’s time. Eat or cook immediately.<br>
                       >>Pick fruits when firm if they are to be frozen.<br>
                       >> Be sure top pick with the cherry stem so you do not tear into the fruit, however, take care to lead the fruit spur to produce fruit next year.<br>
                       >>Hand-picking may injure the shoots and cause infection; Cut the stalks with scissors.<br>
                       >>Remember that cherry trees do not bear fruit until their fourth year. Thereafter, they should produce about 30 to 50 quarts of cherries each year.
