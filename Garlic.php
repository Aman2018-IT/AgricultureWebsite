    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">It can be cultivated on various soil types. It gives best result when grown in sandy loam and silt loam soils rich in organic matter. Loose and sandy soils are not suitable for cultivation as bulb produce in such soil are deformed with less keeping quality. pH of soil should be 6 to 7.</p>

                        In average soils, garlic needs about 16 inches of total water during a growing season, or about 1/2-inch-to-1-inch of water per week, with more water during warm weather and rapid growth, and less water during cold weather, as cloves are first sprouting, and for 2-4 weeks before harvest.

                            Give three to four deep ploughing and bring soil to fine tilth. Add well decomposed cow dung to increase organic content of soil. Then levelled soil and divide into small plots and channels.<br><br>

                            Time of sowing:
                            Optimum time for sowing is last week of September to first week of October.<br><br>

                            Spacing:
                            Keep spacing of 7.5 cm between two plant and 15 cm between the rows.<br><br>
 
                            Sowing Depth:
                            Sow garlic cloves 3 to 5 cm deep keeping their growing heads upward.<br><br>

                            Method of sowing:
                            For sowing of garlic use Kera method. Sowing can be done manually or with help of Machine. Cover cloves with soil and provide light irrigation.
                            <br><br>

                            Seed Rate:
                            Use seed rate of 225-250 kg per acre.<br><br>
                            
                            Seed Treatment:
                            Seed treatment with Thiram@2 gm/kg of seed + Benomyl 50WP@1 gm/liter water effectively controls damping off and smut diseases. After chemical treatment, seed treatment with bio agent Trichoderma viride@2 gm/kg of seed is recommended, it help in reducing early seedling diseases and soil borne inoculum. <br><br>

Plants are pull out or uprooted, then tied into small bundle and kept in field or shade for 2-3days. After proper drying, dry stalks are removed and bulbs are cleaned.

                             Thrips: If it is not controlled properly, can cause yield loss up to 50%. Mostly observed in dry weather. They suck sap from the foliage and results in curling of leaves, leaves become cup shaped or curved upward. <br><br>
                             Maggots: Infestation observed in January-February Month. They feed on roots cause browning of leaves. Base of plant become watery.


                             If infestation is observed, apply Carbaryl@4 kg or Phorate@4 kg to the soil and give light irrigation. Apply Chlorpyriphos @1 Ltr/acre alongwith irrigation water or sand. <br><br>

                              Purple blotch and stem phylium blight: In severe infestation may cause yield loss up to 70%. Deep purple lesions are observed on leaves. Yellow streaks get turn brown and extend along the blade. <br> <br>
    
    
                              Take spray of Propineb70%WP@350 gm/acre/150 ltr of water, twice at 10 days interval.
