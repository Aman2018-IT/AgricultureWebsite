            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Clitoria ternatea enjoys full sun for vital growth. However, this easy-to-grow plant thrives in low light conditions including partial shade. It also tolerates cool and moist climatic conditions to some extent but wants frost free conditions.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The soil can be fertile to a moderate level and it must be moist.

                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"> Butterfly peas prefer regular watering in the first growing season to absorb nutrients in the soil. The spurred variety is drought-tolerant but once it matures, it requires small but additional amounts of irrigation, especially in hot and dry weather conditions.
