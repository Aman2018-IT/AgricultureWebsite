            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Tibouchina semidecandra, the princess flower, glory bush, or lasiandra, is a flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is a sprawling, evergreen shrub or small ornamental tree native to Brazil and ranges from 10 to 15 feet (20 feet with proper training) in height. It can be trimmed to any size and still put on a vivid, year-long flower display. </i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Tibouchina flowers in the late spring or mid-summer. They'll do well with little environmental fluctuation and should be kept in temperatures around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Tibouchina disikes extreme hot or cold temperatures and should be kept away from any harsh drafts or breezes.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;"> They need a good sunny position and like to be planted into a rich acidic soil. They don't like alkaline soils (those soils with a pH of 7 or above), but flourish in slightly acidic soils with a pH of around 5.5 to 6.5. If your soil is alkaline, the pH can be lowered by adding to the soil Sulphur Powder. Follow the directions on the container to suit your soil type.

                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">When first planting a Tibouchina, they will need regular watering until established, to ensure a good start to their life. Once they have established a good deep root system (after the first year), a good deep watering once a week should suffice. If you live in an area that receives a moderate to high rainfall, you may very well find that these beautiful shrubs will hardly need any additional watering at all.
