            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>It is imagined that the species was introduced to the Middle East in ancient times, and legend associates it with the crown of thorns worn by Christ. It is commonly used as an ornamental houseplant that can be grown in warmer climates.</i></p>

            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">To grow happy and healthy, the Euphorbia Milii needs at least half a day of sunlight and a temperature between 65-75 °F (18-24 °C). It is not an issue if the temperatures drop a little at night as this succulent can tolerate temperatures as low as 50 °F (10 °C).</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">	A fast-draining medium such as cactus potting mix works best.They don’t mind rocky or sandy soil and soil that’s nutrient-poor and they can withstand long periods without water. It’s recommended to apply the ‘soak and dry’ watering technique to avoid leaf drop and to encourage the flowers to bloom.

    <div class="Water">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">But like most succulents and cacti, the Euphorbia Milii prefers drought instead of too much moisture and hates sitting in in water or wet soil for too long. The best watering technique for the Euphorbia is the ‘soak and dry’ technique that consists of watering the plant thoroughly, removing the extra water from the saucer, and letting the soil dry completely before watering again.
