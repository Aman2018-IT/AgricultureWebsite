          <h1 style=" font-size: 60px; text-align: center; color: white;"><i>BOUGAINVILLEA</i></h1>
    

    
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>Bougainvillea, (genus Bougainvillea), genus of about 18 species of shrubs, vines, or small trees, belonging to the four-o'clock family (Nyctaginaceae), native to South America. Many species are thorny.</i></p>
        
        
    <div class="Weather">
        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Bougainvillea is a heat-loving plant that can tolerate temperatures above 100 degrees F on the high side, but it performs best when temperatures stay above 60 degrees F on the low side.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">They're not too fussy about soil type but it must drain freely. A mixture of loam and organic compost worked into the native soil is what works best for them.</p>

    <div class="Water">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                                   
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">When it comes to watering, Bougainvillea is pretty drought tolerant once established. It prefers a good, deep watering every 3-4 weeks rather than frequent shallow waterings.

                        When establishing (in the 1st couple of years), be sure to give your bougainvillea regular water. It’s subject to a few types of root rots so don’t over-water. The soil should be well-drained which will help prevent rot.
