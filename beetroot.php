            <p style="color: white;font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><i>BeetRoot(Beta Vulgaris) is a root vegetable also known as RedBeet,TableBeet,GardenBeet or just Beet.</i></p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Weather Conditions:</i></strong></h2>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Beetroot is essentially a cool weather crop but it can be grown in a moderately warm climate as it attains best colour, texture and quality in a cool weather condition. A temperature range of 18-21°C is considered as ideal for obtaining good quality roots, rich in sugar with intense red colour.</p>

    <div class="Soil">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Soil requirement:</i></strong></h3>        
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Generally beetroot can be grown on many types of soils; however loamy soil is considered the best out of all the varieties. Anything between 6.3 to 7.5 pH levels is considered good for growing beetroots. Too much acidic soil is not good for beetroot cultivation.</p>

        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Place of cultivation:</i></strong></h3>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">In India Beetroot is mainly cultivated in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra. </p>

    <div class="Pesticides">     
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Pesticides requirement(For weed Control):</i></strong></h3>
            
                    <strong><i><p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">1.<u>Chloridazon (Pyramin)</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                        Chloridazon is applied after planting but before emergence. It must be applied to a moist soil to be effective. So apply either after good rainfall or after irrigation. Apply the chemical as soon after planting as possible as any contact with the leaves of the seedlings will cause damage and a reduction of yields. Some varieties are more sensitive to Chloridazon than others. So expect some loss of seedlings with Crimson Globe for instance.<br>
                        All chemicals are sensitive to pH, organic soil content, clay content, temperature and humidity. Pyramin applied during warm conditions will result in poor weed control and possible lower yields.<br>
                        Chloridazon is designed to control most annual broadleaf weeds. The following weeds are controlled:<br>
                   <strong>  1. Quick weed such as Galinsoga parviflora<br>
                        2. Pig weed – Amaranthus spp.<br>
                        3. Cow thistle Sonchus spp.<br>
                        4. Purslane – Portulaca oleracea and Blue grass – Poa annua<br>
                        Goosefoot  Chenopodium spp. and goose-grass Eleusine africana are fairly well controlled.</strong>  
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><i>2.<u>Sethoxydim (Nabu)</u>:-</i></strong><br> 
                    Nabu is a post emergence herbicide for the control of annual grasses only. It must be applied when the grass is in the 2nd leaf to 3rd tiller stage. So they must be very young and small. Beetroot is tolerant to this chemical so it can be applied at any growth stage.
                    <br><br>

    <div class="Water">    
        <h3 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: left; color: white;"><strong><i>Water Requirement:</i></strong></h3>
                
                    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The total crop water requirement for beetroot is 2.5 - 3.5 ML/ha
                        per season with a total irrigation requirement of approximately
                        2.2 - 3.0 ML/ha, allowing for inefficiencies and drainage losses.
                        This should produce a crop yield of approximately 16 - 24 t/ha for
                        baby beets and 30 - 40 t/ha for slicing beetroot.

                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;"><strong><i>1.<u>Land preparation and sowing</u>:</i></strong><br>
                          
                            Being a cool season crop, beet root is raised during winter in plains and as a springsummer crop in hills by March-April. In plains, sowing is practiced during SeptemberNovember.
                            Land is ploughed to a fine tilth by thorough ploughing making it loose and friable. Clods
                            are to be removed completely. Apply well decomposed farmyard manure at the time of final
                            ploughing. Flat beds or ridges and furrows are prepared. Water-soaked ‘seed balls’ which
                            contain 2-6 seeds are drilled 2.5 cm deep in rows at spacing of 45-60 x 8-10 cm. 5-6 kg of
                            seeds is required for one hectare. Staggered sowing at 1-2 weeks interval ensures steady
                            supply of roots during the season.
                                 <br><br>
                        <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;">
                            <strong><i>2.<u> Manures and fertilizers</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            On sandy soils, organic manure @ 25 t/ha is recommended. For an average soil, 60-70
                            kg N, 100-120 kg P and 60-70 kg K/ha is recommended. Entire farmyard manure, half of N and
                            full P and K should be applied basal at the time of land preparation prior to sowing and
                            remaining at 30-45 days after sowing. Nitrate sources of N are preferred to ammonium sources.
                            Beets have a relatively high boron requirement and its deficiency causes internal breakdown as
                            black rot or dry rot. <br><br>
                            <p style="color: white;font-size: 17px;">
                                <strong><i>3.<u>Aftercare</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            Thinning is an essential operation when more than one seedling germinates from each
                            seed. Moist soil is essential for seed germination and for further growth. Usually 5-6 irrigations
                            are usually given during summer and three irrigations during winter in North Indian plains.
                            Field is usually kept weed free by light hoeing at early stage of crop. Swollen roots are
                            also to be covered with soil by earthing up.

                                <strong><i>4.<u>Harvesting</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            
                            Medium sized tubers are of great demand and tubers are harvested after attaining a
                            diameter of 3-5 cm. Harvesting is done 8-10 weeks after sowing by pulling the top with hand.
                            Later tops are removed, graded and marketed. In European countries, where small sized
                            bunches are in demand, tubers are tied in bundles of 4-6 with their tops. Over matured and
                            oversized tubers become woody and crack. Yield varies from 25 to 30t/ha and the tuber stores
                            well at 0o
                            C and 90% RH.

                                <strong><i>5.<u>Seed Production</u>:</i></strong><br>
                            Unlike other root crops, annual tropical types do not exist in beet root. All cultivars in
                            beet root are temperate biennial types and seed production is possible in hills 1400 m above
                            mean sea level. A low temperature of 4.4 to 7.7o
                            C for 6-8 weeks is required for flowers to
                            initiate. Usual method of seed production is root to seed method. In this method, seeds are
                            sown in July and well developed roots are dug out during November-December. After selection
                            of root tubers, top is trimmed without injuring crown. Then whole tubers of selected plants are
                            transplanted at a spacing of 60 x 45-60 cm in well prepared fields and irrigated. Harvesting is 
                            done during June-July. Cross pollination is due to self incompatibility. Being a cross pollinated
                            crop, that too wind pollinated, provide an isolation distance of 1000 m for certified seed
                            production and 1600 m for breeder and nucleus seed production. Average seed yield is 2.0
                            t/ha.

                            Pests and diseases
                            Insect pests like leaf miners, web worms, semi loopers; fungal diseases like Cercospora
                            leaf spot and downy mildew and viral diseases cause damage in beet root cultivation.
